# Email "to" Argument Error - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The error `TypeError: The "to" argument must be of type string. Received undefined` was occurring in the email automation system that runs every hour via cron job.

## Root Cause
The `processSequenceEmail` function in `lib/email-automation.ts` was attempting to send emails without validating that subscriber email addresses were valid strings.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Email Validation in Email Automation
**File**: `lib/email-automation.ts`

- Added validation before sending emails in `processSequenceEmail` function
- Added validation in `sendAutomatedEmail` function as a safety net
- Both functions now check that email is:
  - Not null/undefined
  - A string type
  - Contains '@' symbol

### 2. Enhanced Contact Form Validation
**File**: `pages/api/send-email.ts`

- Improved email validation to check for valid format
- Returns 400 error for invalid emails

### 3. Database Check
- Created script to check for invalid subscriber emails
- Confirmed no subscribers have invalid emails in the database

### 4. Error Logging Infrastructure
**File**: `supabase/create-email-automation-errors-table.sql`

- Created SQL for error logging table
- Tracks failed email attempts with details
- Includes proper indexes and RLS policies

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** to prevent future errors
2. **Run the SQL script** in Supabase dashboard to create error logging table
3. **Monitor logs** for any email sending failures
4. **Consider adding**:
   - Email validation on all form inputs
   - Admin dashboard to view email errors
   - Retry logic for temporary failures

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. The email automation will run automatically on the next cron schedule
2. Any invalid emails will be logged instead of crashing the process
3. Valid emails will continue to be sent normally

## Monitoring
Check for errors using:
```sql
SELECT * FROM email_automation_errors 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
