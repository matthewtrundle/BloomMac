# Wellness Hub Database Schema Fixes

## 🔍 Audit Results

We've completed a comprehensive audit of the wellness hub database schema. Here's what we found:

### ✅ Working Correctly (6/10 tests passed):
- `user_profiles` - Core user data
- `user_achievements` - Achievement tracking
- `user_preferences` - Privacy/notification settings
- `subscribers` - Newsletter subscriptions
- `courses` - Course definitions with modules and lessons
- `course_progress` - User progress tracking

### ❌ Issues Found (4/10 tests failed):

1. **`user_activity_log`** - Missing columns: `ip_address`
   - API expects: `user_id`, `action`, `ip_address`, `metadata`
   - Impact: Privacy settings changes can't be logged

2. **`contact_submissions`** - Missing columns: `first_name`, `last_name`
   - API expects separate first/last name fields
   - Likely has a combined `name` field instead

3. **`analytics_events`** - Missing column: `metadata`
   - API tries to store additional data in metadata field
   - Impact: Can't track detailed analytics data

4. **RPC Function** - `get_dashboard_data` doesn't exist
   - Needed for dashboard data aggregation
   - Impact: Dashboard may not load user data properly

## 🛠️ Fix Script Created

I've created a comprehensive SQL script at `scripts/fix-wellness-hub-schema.sql` that:

1. **Adds missing columns** to tables with proper data types
2. **Creates the missing RPC function** for dashboard data
3. **Adds performance indexes** on frequently queried columns
4. **Includes data migration** logic (e.g., splitting `name` into `first_name`/`last_name`)
5. **Verifies the fixes** with a check query

## 📋 Action Required

1. **Run the fix script** in your Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy contents of scripts/fix-wellness-hub-schema.sql
   ```

2. **Test the APIs** after applying fixes:
   ```bash
   node scripts/verify-api-queries.js
   ```

3. **Update any APIs** that might need adjustment based on actual column names

## 🔐 Security Status

Good news: All these tables now have RLS enabled (from your earlier fix), so once the schema issues are resolved, your wellness hub will be fully secured and functional.

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Add updated_at triggers** - Automatically update timestamps on row changes
2. **Create foreign key constraints** - Ensure referential integrity
3. **Regular backups** - Especially for user data and achievements
4. **Monitor slow queries** - The indexes added should help performance

The wellness hub is well-architected overall. These fixes will resolve the remaining schema mismatches and ensure all APIs work correctly.
