# ✅ Pre-Deployment Verification Checklist

## 🔍 Current Status

### Database
- ✅ Auth fix migration applied (`check_user_role_unified` function exists)
- ✅ All required tables exist
- ✅ RLS policies in place
- ✅ Admin users can login (2 admins in `admin_users`)

### Code
- ✅ 25 secure routes ready to replace originals
- ✅ Archive script ready to swap routes safely
- ✅ Test script ready to verify deployment

## 📋 Final Checks Before Deployment

### 1. Local Testing
```bash
# Test the routes BEFORE archiving
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test routes:
node scripts/test_deployed_routes.js local
```

### 2. Check Git Status
```bash
# Make sure you're on the right branch
git status

# Ensure no uncommitted changes
git diff
```

### 3. Backup Current State
```bash
# Create a git backup branch
git checkout -b backup-pre-phase1-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git checkout main

# Backup database (in Supabase dashboard)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Sequence

### Step 1: Archive & Test Locally
```bash
# Archive old routes and activate secure ones
node scripts/archive_old_routes.js archive

# Test immediately
npm run dev
node scripts/test_deployed_routes.js local

# If ANY issues, restore immediately:
node scripts/archive_old_routes.js restore
```

### Step 2: Commit & Deploy
```bash
# If tests pass, commit
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Deploy Phase 1 security improvements

- Remove service role usage from all API routes
- Add proper authentication and authorization
- Implement input validation with Zod
- Add rate limiting to public endpoints
- Archive original routes for rollback capability"

# Deploy (adjust for your platform)
git push origin main
# OR
vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Test production
node scripts/test_deployed_routes.js production

# Monitor logs
vercel logs --follow
# OR check your hosting platform logs
```

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback

If ANYTHING goes wrong:

```bash
# Option 1: Restore from archive (fastest)
node scripts/archive_old_routes.js restore
git add -A  
git commit -m "fix: Rollback Phase 1 deployment"
git push origin main

# Option 2: Git revert
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Option 3: Deploy backup branch
git checkout backup-pre-phase1-[date]
git push origin backup-pre-phase1-[date]:main --force
```

## 🎯 Go/No-Go Criteria

### ✅ GO if:
- Local tests pass (all routes respond correctly)
- No TypeScript errors
- Git status is clean
- You have time to monitor for 2+ hours

### ❌ NO-GO if:
- Any route fails testing
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Uncommitted changes exist
- It's late Friday or before a holiday
- You can't monitor after deployment

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

After successful deployment:
- All API routes work identically (but more securely)
- Admin panel continues to function
- Contact forms still submit
- Newsletter signups work
- NO service role keys in application code
- Audit trail of admin actions

## 🔔 Monitor These Metrics

Post-deployment, watch for:
1. **Error Rate** - Should not increase
2. **Response Times** - Should remain stable
3. **Auth Failures** - 401/403 errors indicate issues
4. **User Reports** - Any functionality complaints

---

**Final Check**: Are you ready to deploy? 
- [ ] Local tests pass
- [ ] Backup created
- [ ] Time to monitor
- [ ] Rollback plan understood

If all checked, proceed with deployment! 🚀
