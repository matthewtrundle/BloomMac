## üí° Strategic Recommendations

- Launch with in-house payment plans only
- Add Affirm after 30 days of data
- Consider Afterpay if younger demographic

### 2. Price Anchoring:

- Make Gold look like best value
- Position Bronze as "minimum effective dose"

### 3. Urgency Tactics:

- "Wellness Box - limited edition, while supplies last"

### 4. Insurance Positioning:
- "Many insurance plans cover our services"
- "We provide superbills for reimbursement"
- "Check your out-of-network mental health benefits"

- 15% buy Silver: 7 √ó $1,297 = $9,079
- 5% buy Gold: 2 √ó $1,897 = $3,794
- 2% buy Platinum: 1 √ó $3,997 = $3,997
- Individual purchases: ~$3,000
- **Total Revenue**: $25,428 (vs $13,662 course-only)

### Payment Plan Impact:

### Operational:
