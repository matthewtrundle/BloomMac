- **Risk factors**: Quantified increases (e.g., previous history +50% risk)
- **Protective factors**: Quantified decreases (e.g., partner support -45% risk)  
- **Neurobiological changes**: Gray matter reduction, amygdala reactivity
- **Evidence-based interventions**: CBT (70% effective), EMDR (84% for trauma)
- **Cultural practices**: 35-45% lower PPD with traditional support
- **Crisis indicators**: Clear red/yellow/green flags

### 2. AI Expert Panel Assembly
