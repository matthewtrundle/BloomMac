## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Stripe Account Setup**

1. **Create Stripe Account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to https://stripe.com
   - Sign up for an account
   - Complete business verification

2. **Get API Keys**:
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard > Developers > API Keys
   - Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**
   - ⚠️ Start with **Test Keys** for development

3. **Create Product Prices in Stripe Dashboard**:
   ```
   Product 1: Postpartum Wellness Foundations
   - Price: $197.00 USD
   - Type: One-time payment
   
   Product 2: Anxiety Management for New Moms  
   - Price: $127.00 USD
   - Type: One-time payment
   
   Product 3: Partner Support Bootcamp
   - Price: $97.00 USD
   - Type: One-time payment
   ```
   
   Save the **Price IDs** (they look like `price_1ABC123...`)

### **Step 2: Environment Variables**

Create/update your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Stripe Keys (GET FROM STRIPE DASHBOARD)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # (Will get this in Step 4)

# Stripe Price IDs (FROM STEP 1)
STRIPE_PRICE_POSTPARTUM_WELLNESS=price_1ABC123...
STRIPE_PRICE_ANXIETY_MANAGEMENT=price_1DEF456...
STRIPE_PRICE_PARTNER_SUPPORT=price_1GHI789...

# Your existing environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_existing_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_existing_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_existing_service_key
```

### **Step 3: Database Setup**

Run the database migration:

```bash
# In your Supabase SQL Editor, run:
./supabase/course-payment-schema.sql
```

This creates the tables:
- `course_purchases` - Track all purchase attempts
- `user_course_access` - Manage who has access to what
- `course_progress` - Track user progress through courses

### **Step 4: Webhook Setup**

1. **In Stripe Dashboard**:
   - Go to Developers > Webhooks
   - Click "Add endpoint"
   - Endpoint URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Select events:
     - `checkout.session.completed`
     - `checkout.session.expired`
     - `payment_intent.payment_failed`

2. **Get Webhook Secret**:
   - After creating webhook, click on it
   - Copy the "Signing secret" (starts with `whsec_`)
   - Add to your environment variables

### **Step 5: Test the System**

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Purchase Flow**:
   - Go to `/courses`
   - Click "Buy Now" on any course
   - Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Complete checkout

3. **Test Course Access**:
   - After successful purchase, go to the success page
   - Try accessing `/learn/postpartum-wellness-foundations`
   - Enter the email you used for purchase

---

## 🎛 **How It Works**

### **Purchase Flow:**
1. User clicks "Buy Now" → Purchase form appears
2. User enters email → Redirected to Stripe Checkout
3. Payment processed → Webhook updates database
4. User redirected to success page → Access granted

### **Access Control:**
- Users enter email to access courses
- System checks `user_course_access` table
- If access found, course content loads
- If no access, prompted to purchase

### **Database Structure:**
- **course_purchases**: All purchase attempts and completions
- **user_course_access**: Active course access per email
- **course_progress**: Learning progress tracking
