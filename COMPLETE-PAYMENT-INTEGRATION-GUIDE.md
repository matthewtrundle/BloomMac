# Complete Payment Integration Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **Payment Flow Integration - COMPLETE**

We've now fully integrated the payment system to avoid any competing platforms and ensure a smooth user experience.

## ðŸ”„ **How Payment Collection Works**

### **User Journey Flow:**

```
1. User clicks "Book Appointment"
   â†“
2. System checks: Do they have a payment method?
   â†“
3a. NO PAYMENT METHOD:
    â†’ Modal appears: "Payment Method Required"
    â†’ User adds credit card securely via Stripe
    â†’ Payment method saved
    â†’ Calendly booking opens automatically
   â†“
3b. HAS PAYMENT METHOD:
    â†’ Calendly booking opens immediately
   â†“
4. User schedules appointment in Calendly
   â†“
5. Calendly webhook fires â†’ Appointment saved to database
   â†“
6. Payment automatically authorized ($150 held)
   â†“
7. Confirmation email sent
   â†“
8. 24 hours before appointment â†’ Payment captured
   â†“
9. If no-show â†’ $50 fee charged automatically
```

## ðŸ“± **Where Payment Data is Captured**

### **Payment Method Collection Points:**

1. **First Appointment Booking** (Primary)
   - User clicks "Book Appointment" 
   - If no payment method â†’ Modal appears
   - Payment added via secure Stripe form
   - Calendly opens immediately after

2. **Appointments Page** (Secondary)
   - User can add/manage payment methods
   - View payment history
   - Update default payment method

3. **NOT in Onboarding** (Intentional)
   - Onboarding focuses on profile setup
   - Payment only required when actually booking
   - Reduces friction for course-only users

## ðŸš« **Competing Systems - RESOLVED**

### **What We Fixed:**

**BEFORE (Potential Conflicts):**
- Calendly might collect payment
- Our system also wants payment
- User confused about where to pay
- Double payment risk

**AFTER (Unified System):**
- Calendly handles ONLY scheduling
- Our system handles ALL payments
- Single payment method storage
- Clear user experience

### **Calendly Configuration:**
```typescript
// Calendly is configured WITHOUT payment collection
const calendlyConfig = {
  url: 'https://calendly.com/bloom-psychology/consultation',
  // NO payment/pricing settings
  prefill: {
    email: user.email,
    name: user.user_metadata?.full_name,
    customAnswers: {
      a1: user.id // Pass user ID for our system
    }
  }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Key Files Updated:**

1. **AppointmentScheduler.tsx** - Enhanced with payment checking
2. **PaymentRequiredModal.tsx** - New modal for payment collection
3. **PaymentMethodManager.tsx** - Existing payment management component

### **Payment Authorization Flow:**
```typescript
// When Calendly appointment is created:
1. Save appointment to database
2. Get appointment ID
3. Create payment intent with Stripe (authorize $150)
4. Link payment to appointment
5. Update appointment with payment status
```

## ðŸ’³ **Payment Method Storage**

### **Where Payment Data Lives:**
- **Stripe** - Actual card details (PCI compliant)
- **Our Database** - Only Stripe payment method IDs
- **Never stored** - Raw card numbers, CVV, etc.

### **User Payment Methods Table:**
```sql
user_payment_methods (
  id,
  user_id,
  stripe_payment_method_id,  -- Reference to Stripe
  card_details (JSONB),      -- Last4, brand, expiry only
  is_default,
  is_active
)
```

## ðŸŽ¨ **User Experience**

### **Scenario 1: New User, First Appointment**
1. User completes onboarding (no payment needed)
2. Goes to dashboard â†’ clicks "Book Appointment"
3. Modal: "Add payment method to continue"
4. Adds credit card securely
5. Calendly opens automatically
6. Books appointment
7. Payment authorized automatically

### **Scenario 2: Existing User, Has Payment Method**
1. User clicks "Book Appointment"
2. Calendly opens immediately (no extra steps)
3. Books appointment
4. Payment authorized automatically

### **Scenario 3: User Manages Payment Methods**
1. Goes to `/appointments` page
2. "Payments" tab shows all payment methods
3. Can add new methods, set defaults
4. View payment history

## ðŸ”’ **Security & Compliance**

### **PCI Compliance:**
- All card data handled by Stripe
- No sensitive data in our database
- Stripe Elements for secure card collection
- HTTPS everywhere

### **User Privacy:**
- Payment methods stored per user
- RLS policies prevent cross-user access
- Optional payment method deletion

## ðŸ“Š **Payment Tracking**

### **What We Track:**
```sql
appointment_payments (
  appointment_id,
  user_id,
  amount_cents,
  stripe_payment_intent_id,
  status,              -- pending, authorized, charged, failed
  payment_type,        -- appointment, no_show_fee
  authorized_at,
  charged_at
)
```

### **Payment Statuses:**
- **pending** - Payment intent created
- **authorized** - Funds held (at booking)
- **charged** - Funds captured (24hrs before)
- **failed** - Payment failed
- **refunded** - Money returned

## ðŸš€ **What's Automated**

### **Automatic Processes:**
1. **Payment Authorization** - When appointment booked
2. **Payment Capture** - 24 hours before appointment
3. **No-Show Fees** - 15 minutes after missed appointment
4. **Reminder Sending** - 24hr and 2hr before appointment
5. **Payment Retry** - Failed payments retry 3 times

### **Cron Jobs Handle:**
- Reminder sending (hourly)
- Payment capture (hourly)
- No-show processing (every 30 min)

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Cases:**
1. **New user books first appointment** (payment setup flow)
2. **User with payment method books** (immediate booking)
3. **Payment method expires** (failure handling)
4. **User cancels during payment setup** (graceful exit)
5. **Multiple payment methods** (default selection)
6. **No-show scenario** (automatic fee charging)
