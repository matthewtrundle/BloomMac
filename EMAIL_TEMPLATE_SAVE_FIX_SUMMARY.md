# Email Template Save Fix Summary

## Issue
The email template editor was returning "failed to save" errors when trying to save edited templates.

## Root Cause
The `/api/email-templates` endpoint was missing proper authentication checks. While it was logging authentication info, it wasn't actually verifying that the user was authenticated and had admin privileges.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Authentication Check (`/pages/api/email-templates.ts`)
- Added proper authentication verification at the start of the handler
- Checks for `x-user-email` and `x-user-role` headers set by middleware
- Returns 403 Forbidden if user is not authenticated or not an admin
- Now uses the authenticated user's email for the `modified_by` field

### 2. Email Templates Table Already Exists
- Verified that `email_templates_custom` table exists in Supabase
- Table structure includes:
  - `sequence` and `step` to identify which template
  - `subject` and `content` for the customized template
  - `modified_by` to track who made changes
  - `updated_at` timestamp
  - Unique constraint on (sequence, step) for upsert operations

### 3. Authentication Flow
- User logs in at `/admin/login`
- JWT token is set as HTTP-only cookie
- Middleware validates JWT for protected routes (including `/api/email-templates`)
- Middleware adds user info to request headers
- API endpoint checks these headers before allowing operations

## Result
The email template editor now:
- Uses the same JWT authentication as all other admin features
- Properly saves edited templates to the database
- Tracks who modified each template and when
- Falls back to local file storage if database fails
- No longer requires a separate password

## Testing
To test the email template editor:
1. Login to admin panel at `/admin/login`
2. Navigate to Email Editor from the sidebar
3. Select any template to edit
4. Make changes to subject or content
5. Click Save - it should now save successfully
6. The template will show "Last modified by: [your email]"

## Key Code Changes

```typescript
// Added authentication check
const userEmail = req.headers['x-user-email'];
const userRole = req.headers['x-user-role'];

if (!userEmail || userRole !== 'admin') {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
}

// Use authenticated user for tracking
modified_by: userEmail as string
```

The email template editor is now fully integrated with the admin panel's authentication system and should work reliably.
