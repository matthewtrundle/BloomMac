2. **No isolation** - Always hint at support nearby
3. **No darkness** - Everything in natural, warm light
4. **No despair** - Tired but coping, struggling but supported
5. **Active coping** - Show tools being used, not just struggle
6. **Progress visible** - Journey shows improvement
7. **Dignity maintained** - Mothers as capable, not victims

## Color Grading Note

Add to all prompts: "warm color grading, soft morning or golden hour light, gentle and healing atmosphere"

## Validation vs. Hope Balance

For every image showing struggle, ensure:
- Support is visible or implied
- Coping tools are in use
- Environment is bright and safe

- There's a path forward visible
