## The Truth About Therapy (And Why It's Nothing Like You Think)

*February 14, 2025 • 5 min read*

"So... do I just lie on a couch and talk about my childhood?"

I smiled when Emma asked this during our first phone call. It's such a common question, and I get it—most of what we know about therapy comes from movies and TV shows.

Let me paint you a real picture of what therapy actually looks like.

### First Things First: The Couch Thing

Yes, I have a couch. No, you don't have to lie on it. Most clients sit in a comfy chair, kick off their shoes if they want, and we talk like two humans having a meaningful conversation.

Sometimes clients bring coffee. Sometimes they bring their baby. Sometimes they cry. Sometimes we laugh. It's a lot more normal than you'd think.

### What Really Happens in Session One

**The Paperwork Part** (5-10 minutes)
We handle the boring stuff quickly—consent forms, privacy policies, the usual. I try to make this as painless as possible.

**The Getting-to-Know-You Part** (15-20 minutes)
I'll ask what brought you in, but not in an interrogation way. More like, "What's going on that made you think, 'Maybe I should talk to someone'?"

**The "How Can I Help?" Part** (20-25 minutes)
We talk about what you're hoping to get from therapy. Specific goals, general support, or just a safe space to process—all valid.

**The "What's Next?" Part** (5-10 minutes)
We discuss how often to meet, what to expect, and any questions you have. No pressure, no judgment.

### Common Fears (And the Reality)

**Fear: "I'll be judged"**
Reality: I've heard it all. Your thoughts aren't shocking or shameful—they're human.

**Fear: "I'll cry the whole time"**
Reality: Some sessions involve tears, others don't. I've got tissues and zero judgment either way.

**Fear: "I won't know what to say"**
Reality: That's my job—to guide the conversation. You can't do therapy "wrong."

**Fear: "It'll make things worse"**
Reality: Sometimes things feel harder before they feel better, but you're always in control of the pace.

### What Therapy Is Really Like

Imagine having a conversation with someone who:
- Actually listens (like, really listens)
- Doesn't judge your thoughts or feelings
- Helps you see patterns you can't see yourself
- Offers tools and strategies, not just "thoughts and prayers"
- Remembers the important stuff
- Is literally trained to help you feel better

That's therapy.

### The Stuff That Might Surprise You

**It's Not All Heavy**
We might spend a session problem-solving childcare logistics or celebrating a small win. Not every session is deep emotional work.

**You're in Charge**
Don't want to talk about something? Say so. Need to cancel? No guilt trips. Want to try a different approach? Let's do it.

**Progress Isn't Linear**
Some weeks you'll leave feeling amazing. Others, you might feel drained. Both are normal and part of the process.

**Your Therapist Is Human**
I might laugh at your jokes, share a relevant experience (professionally), or admit when I don't have all the answers.

### Signs Therapy Is Working

- You catch yourself using coping strategies we discussed
- You're more aware of your patterns
- Relationships feel a bit easier
- You're kinder to yourself
- You feel heard and understood
- You look forward to sessions (or at least don't dread them)

### When to Give It a Shot

If you're:
- Feeling stuck in the same patterns
- Struggling more than usual
- Curious about understanding yourself better
- Dealing with a life transition
- Just needing someone to talk to

That's enough reason to try therapy.

### The Bottom Line

Therapy isn't about lying on a couch analyzing dreams (unless you want it to be). It's about having a dedicated space and time to focus on you, with someone whose literal job is to help you feel better.

It's okay to be nervous. It's okay to have questions. It's okay to shop around for the right fit. 

What's not okay? Suffering in silence when help is available.

At Bloom, we specialize in making therapy feel approachable, especially for women and moms navigating life's challenges. Your first session is just a conversation—no couches required (unless you prefer it).

Remember: Reaching out doesn't mean you're broken. It means you're brave enough to invest in yourself.

## The Myth of the Perfect Mom (And Why It's Ruining Everything)

*February 21, 2025 • 6 min read*

I was scrolling Instagram last night (yes, therapists do this too) when I saw it: another "day in the life" post from a mom who apparently wakes up at 5 AM to meditate, makes organic breakfast from scratch, homeschools three kids, runs a business, and still has time for date night.

My immediate thought? "Well, that's not real life."

But here's the thing—thousands of moms see these posts and think, "What's wrong with me?"

### The Perfect Mom Mythology

She exists everywhere:
- On social media (with her color-coordinated playroom)
- In mommy blogs (with her meal prep Sundays)
- At school pickup (with her blow-dried hair and clean car)
- In our own heads (judging our every move)

She never yells. Never serves chicken nuggets. Never lets screen time exceed AAP recommendations. Never questions her decisions.

She's also completely fictional.

### The Real Cost of Perfection

When we chase this impossible standard, here's what actually happens:

**The Anxiety Spiral**
"If I don't make homemade baby food, am I poisoning my child?"
"If I work, am I abandoning them? If I don't work, am I setting a bad example?"

**The Comparison Trap**
"Her house is spotless. Mine looks like a tornado hit."
"She lost the baby weight. I'm still in maternity pants."
"Her kids eat vegetables. Mine survive on goldfish crackers."

**The Joy Theft**
When you're so focused on doing it "right," you miss the messy, beautiful moments that matter.

### Real Moms, Real Truth

Here's what actual moms told me this week:

"I fed my kids cereal for dinner last night and felt like a failure until my 4-year-old said it was the best dinner ever." - Sarah

"I yelled this morning. Like, really yelled. Then I apologized, and my daughter said, 'It's okay, Mommy. Everyone has big feelings sometimes.' She was teaching ME." - Maria

"I stopped trying to be the Pinterest mom and started being the 'present mom.' Game changer." - Ashley

### The Permission Slips You Need

Consider this your official permission to:
- Serve mac and cheese (from a box!) for dinner
- Let them watch another episode so you can shower
- Skip the sensory bin craft you saw online
- Say "I don't know" when they ask hard questions
- Have a messy house
- Take time for yourself
- Feel multiple emotions at once
- Make mistakes

### What Kids Actually Need

Research shows kids don't need perfect moms. They need:
- Love (check)
- Safety (check)
- Consistency (mostly check)
- Connection (working on it)
- A parent who can repair after mistakes (learnable)

That's it. Everything else is extra.

### The New Definition of Success

What if instead of "perfect," we aimed for:
- Present over perfect
- Connection over correction
- Progress over perfection
- Authenticity over appearance
- Good enough over Instagram-worthy

### Breaking Free from Perfect

**Step 1: Notice the Thoughts**
"I should be..." is your red flag phrase. Should according to whom?

**Step 2: Reality Check**
Ask yourself: Will this matter in 5 years? 5 months? 5 minutes?

**Step 3: Choose Connection**
When perfectionism calls, choose connection instead. Messy playtime beats perfect playroom every time.

**Step 4: Model Humanity**
Show your kids that mistakes are okay. Apologize when needed. Let them see you're human.

### The Plot Twist

Here's what perfectionism doesn't want you to know: The "perfect" moms you see? They're struggling too. Behind every curated feed is a real woman doubting herself, losing her patience, and serving cereal for dinner.

We're all just doing our best with what we have in the moment. And that's enough.

### Your Kids Don't Need Perfect

They need real. They need you. They need to see that life is messy and beautiful and that love shows up in a million imperfect ways.

So maybe tonight, instead of aiming for perfect, aim for present. Instead of comparing, connect. Instead of should-ing all over yourself, just be.

Because the mom your kids need? She's already there. She's you—imperfections and all.

And trust me, to them, you're already perfect enough.

## Parent Support: Because Raising Humans Is Hard

*January 31, 2025 • 6 min read*

It was 2 AM, and I was googling "is it normal for toddlers to never sleep?" while simultaneously wondering if I was somehow broken as a parent.

Sound familiar?

If parenting came with a manual, it would be 10,000 pages long, contradict itself constantly, and become obsolete every time your kid entered a new phase.

### The Truth Nobody Admits

Parenting is:
- Harder than you expected
- Different than you imagined
- More isolating than it should be
- Not intuitive for everyone
- A skill you can learn and improve

Yet somehow, we're all supposed to magically know what to do the moment that baby arrives.

### The Stages Nobody Warns You About

**The "What Have We Done?" Stage** (0-3 months)
You love this tiny human fiercely but also wonder if you've made a terrible mistake. Normal.

**The "I Thought It Would Be Easier By Now" Stage** (4-12 months)
Sleep regression, teething, crawling, separation anxiety. When does it get easier? (Spoiler: It gets different, not easier.)

**The "Toddler Terrorist" Stage** (1-3 years)
They're cute. They're evil. They're cute again. The emotional whiplash is real.

**The "Big Feelings, Little Body" Stage** (3-5 years)
Meltdowns over sock seams. Existential crises over sandwich shapes. Wednesday.

**The "I Thought I'd Be Better At This By Now" Stage** (Ongoing)
Every phase brings new challenges. You never feel quite prepared.

### What Parent Support Actually Looks Like

It's not about being told what to do. It's about:

**Validation**
"Yes, it's this hard for everyone. No, you're not failing."

**Practical Strategies**
"Here's what to try when they won't stay in bed."

**Perspective**
"This phase will pass. I promise."

**Community**
"You're not alone in this."

**Skills Building**
"Let's practice how to handle tantrums."

### Real Questions from Real Parents

These came up in sessions this week:

"My 2-year-old hits. Am I raising a sociopath?"
(No. Toddlers hit because they have big feelings and no words.)

"I don't enjoy playing with my kids. Am I a bad parent?"
(No. Not everyone loves imaginative play. Find what you DO enjoy together.)

"I yelled. Again. Have I traumatized them?"
(No. Repair is possible and teaches resilience.)

"My teenager hates me. Is this forever?"
(No. It's developmental. Still hurts though.)

### The Support You Didn't Know You Needed

**Scripts for Hard Conversations**
"When your 4-year-old asks about death..."
"When your teen pushes boundaries..."
"When siblings won't stop fighting..."

**Boundary Setting (For You)**
"No, you don't have to host every playdate."
"Yes, you can take a break."
"It's okay to not enjoy every moment."

**Realistic Expectations**
What's normal at each age? When should you worry? When should you wait it out?

**Your Own Stuff**
How your childhood affects your parenting. What triggers you. How to break cycles.

### The Permission Slips Parents Need

You're allowed to:
- Not love every phase
- Need breaks
- Make mistakes
- Change your approach
- Ask for help
- Feel overwhelmed
- Prioritize your relationship
- Have interests beyond your kids

### When Parent Support Helps Most

- During transitions (new baby, divorce, moving)
- With challenging behaviors
- When you're stuck in power struggles
- If parenting triggers your own trauma
- When you and your partner disagree
- During teen years (aka "what happened to my sweet child?")
- Anytime you feel lost

### The Magic of "Good Enough"

Perfect parents raise anxious kids. Good enough parents raise resilient ones.

Good enough means:
- Consistent, not constant
- Present, not perfect
- Responsive, not reactive
- Human, not superhuman

### What Changes with Support

Parents tell me:
- "I actually enjoy bedtime now"
- "I stopped dreading the teenage years"
- "I'm less reactive"
- "I understand my kid better"
- "I'm breaking generational patterns"
- "I feel confident in my decisions"

### The Truth About Parenting

You can love your kids deeply and still:
- Need time alone
- Feel frustrated
- Question your choices
- Want your old life sometimes
- Struggle with certain phases
- Need support

None of this makes you a bad parent. It makes you human.

### You Don't Have to Do This Alone

At Bloom, we offer parent support that's practical, judgment-free, and actually helpful. Because raising humans is hard, and you deserve support while doing it.

Remember: The fact that you're wondering if you're doing it right means you're probably doing better than you think.

Your kids don't need a perfect parent. They need you—supported, confident, and human.

## Life Transitions: When Everything Changes at Once

*February 7, 2025 • 5 min read*

Three months ago, Lisa sat in my office looking completely overwhelmed. In the span of six weeks, she'd had a baby, moved to Austin, and her partner started a demanding new job.

"I don't even know who I am anymore," she said, tears streaming down her face.

If you're nodding along, this one's for you.

### When It All Happens at Once

Life has this funny way of throwing all the changes at us at the same time:
- New baby + new city
- Job loss + relationship changes
- Move + family illness
- Career change + becoming a parent
- Divorce + starting over

One change? Manageable. Three or four? That's when we start coming undone.

### Why Transitions Hit So Hard

**Identity Confusion**
"Am I still the career woman if I'm home with a baby?"
"Who am I in this new city where nobody knows me?"
"What defines me now that everything's different?"

**Loss of Anchors**
Your favorite coffee shop. Your running route. Your people. The familiar rhythms that grounded you—gone.

**Decision Fatigue**
New job? Hundreds of decisions. New city? Where to shop, eat, find childcare. New baby? Decisions all day long.

**Grief Nobody Acknowledges**
You're grieving your old life, even if the changes are good. But who can you tell that to?

### The Transition Survival Guide

**Accept the Mess**
Your life looks like a construction zone because it IS one. You're building something new. It's supposed to be messy.

**Lower the Bar**
"Thriving" is not the goal right now. Surviving is enough. Cereal for dinner? Victory. Everyone alive at bedtime? Winning.

**Find One Anchor**
Pick ONE familiar thing to maintain. Maybe it's your morning coffee ritual. Maybe it's Sunday phone calls home. One thread of continuity helps.

**Name the Losses**
"I miss my old neighborhood."
"I miss knowing where everything is."
"I miss my pre-baby body."
"I miss certainty."

Say it out loud. Write it down. Acknowledge what you've lost.

### The Unexpected Gifts of Transition

Here's what nobody tells you: Transitions—as hellish as they are—often lead to the best versions of ourselves.

**You Discover What Matters**
When everything's stripped away, you see what's essential. Spoiler: It's usually not what you thought.

**You Build Resilience**
If you can survive this chaos, you can survive anything. You're becoming bulletproof.

**You Shed Old Patterns**
New environment = chance to break old habits. No one here knows the "old you."

**You Find Your People**
Crisis reveals who shows up. Transition attracts helpers. Your tribe emerges.

### Real Stories of Hope

**Sarah's Story**
"Six months after our cross-country move, I realized I'd become who I always wanted to be. The move forced me to shed everyone else's expectations."

**Maria's Story**
"Becoming a mom while starting my business was insanity. But somehow, I found a version of me that could do both—imperfectly but authentically."

**James's Story**
"Divorce + job loss felt like the end. A year later, I'm in the career I always wanted and co-parenting better than we ever parented together."

### The Timeline Nobody Shares

Month 1-3: Complete chaos. Survival mode. This is normal.
Month 4-6: Glimmers of routine. Still hard but managing.
Month 7-9: Finding rhythm. Feeling more yourself.
Month 10-12: Looking back amazed at how far you've come.

Give yourself a full year. Seriously.

### When to Get Support

If you're:
- Unable to see any positives
- Isolating completely
- Using unhealthy coping mechanisms
- Feeling hopeless about the future
- Struggling with daily tasks
- Having thoughts of escape

Time to reach out. Transitions are hard enough without doing them alone.

### The Plot Twist

That feeling of not knowing who you are anymore? It's not a crisis—it's an opportunity. You get to decide who you become in this new chapter.

The old you got you here. Time to meet the new you.

### Permission to Be Human

You're allowed to:
- Feel excited and terrified simultaneously
- Grieve what you've lost while embracing what's new
- Have bad days (or weeks)
- Not have it all figured out
- Change your mind
- Ask for help
- Take time to adjust

### You're Not Starting Over

You're starting WITH. With all the wisdom, strength, and experience you've gathered. This transition isn't erasing your past—it's building on it.

At Bloom, we specialize in helping people navigate life's biggest transitions. Because sometimes you need someone to remind you that this chaos is temporary, but the growth is permanent.

Remember: You've survived 100% of your worst days so far. You'll survive this transition too.

And who knows? You might just thrive.
