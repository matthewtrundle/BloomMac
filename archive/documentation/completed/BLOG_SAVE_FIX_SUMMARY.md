# Blog Save Fix Summary

## Issue
The blog editor was returning "failed to save" errors when trying to create or update blog posts.

## Root Cause
The blog-admin API endpoint was using Bearer token authentication with `ADMIN_API_KEY` while the rest of the admin system uses JWT-based authentication with cookies. This mismatch caused authentication failures.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Blog Admin API (`/pages/api/blog-admin.ts`)
- Changed from Bearer token authentication to JWT authentication via middleware
- Now uses headers set by middleware: `x-user-email` and `x-user-role`
- Removed dependency on `ADMIN_API_KEY`

### 2. Updated BlogEditor Component (`/components/admin/BlogEditor.tsx`)
- Changed all fetch requests to use `credentials: 'include'`
- Removed Bearer token from headers
- This includes both post save and image upload functionality

### 3. Updated Blog Admin Page (`/app/admin/blog/page.tsx`)
- Changed delete functionality to use `credentials: 'include'`
- Removed Bearer token authentication

### 4. Updated Blog Edit Page (`/app/admin/blog/edit/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Changed post fetching to use `credentials: 'include'`
- Removed Bearer token authentication

### 5. Updated Upload Image API (`/pages/api/upload-image.ts`)
- Changed from Bearer token authentication to JWT authentication via middleware
- Now uses headers set by middleware: `x-user-email` and `x-user-role`
- The endpoint was already included in protected routes in middleware.ts

## Result
All blog editor functionality now uses the same JWT-based authentication as the rest of the admin panel. This means:
- Single login for all admin features
- No need to remember multiple passwords
- Consistent authentication across the entire admin interface

## Testing
To test the blog editor:
1. Login to admin panel at `/admin/login`
2. Navigate to Blog Posts from the sidebar
3. Try creating a new post or editing an existing one
4. The save functionality should now work properly without authentication errors

## Authentication Flow
1. User logs in at `/admin/login` with email and password
2. JWT token is set as an HTTP-only cookie
3. Middleware intercepts all protected routes and validates the JWT
4. If valid, user info is added to request headers
5. API endpoints check for these headers to authorize requests
