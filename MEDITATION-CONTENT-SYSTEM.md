# Meditation Content System - Consistency Guide

## üéØ **Current Issues Found**

### **Inconsistent Duration References:**
‚ùå Old file: "10-minute grounding practice" (hardcoded in `/app/course/week1/database-page.tsx`)  
‚úÖ Current system: "Grounding Meditation for New Moms (8 min)"  
‚úÖ Actual script: 8-10 minutes (adjustable by pace)

### **Multiple Description Sources:**
1. **WeekContent component** - Dynamic resource descriptions
2. **Course page** - Static curriculum descriptions  
3. **Old components** - Hardcoded legacy descriptions
4. **Database** - Should be single source of truth

## üîß **SYSTEMATIC FIXES NEEDED**

### **1. Clean Up Old Files**
- [ ] Remove or update `/app/course/week1/database-page.tsx` (has hardcoded descriptions)
- [ ] Audit all components for hardcoded meditation descriptions
- [ ] Ensure only WeekContent component defines resource descriptions

### **2. Update WeekContent Component**
Current WeekContent component should be updated to use the master specifications:

```typescript
const getWeekResources = (weekNum: number) => {
  const weekResources: Record<number, any[]> = {
    1: [
      {
        icon: Headphones,
        title: 'Grounding Meditation for New Moms',
        description: 'Foundational grounding practice for fourth trimester (8-10 min)',
        link: '/resources/week1-meditation.mp3'
      }
    ],
    2: [
      {
        icon: Headphones,
        title: 'Self-Compassion Break Meditation',
        description: 'Dr. Kristin Neff\'s self-compassion protocol for mothers (10 min)',
        link: '/resources/week2-meditation.mp3'
      }
    ],
    // etc...
  };
};
```

### **3. Database Integration**
Store meditation metadata in database for consistency:

```sql
-- Add meditation_data column to course_modules table
ALTER TABLE course_modules ADD COLUMN meditation_data JSONB;

-- Example data structure:
{
  "title": "Grounding Meditation for New Moms",
  "duration_minutes": 10,
  "description": "Foundational grounding practice for fourth trimester",
  "techniques": ["body_scan", "breath_awareness", "self_compassion"],
  "script_path": "/resources/week1-meditation-script.md",
  "audio_path": "/resources/week1-meditation.mp3"
}
```
