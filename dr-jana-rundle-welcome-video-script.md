## Duration: 2:30 - 3:00 minutes

---

### [0:00 - 0:05] OPENING SHOT
*[Soft, natural lighting. Dr. Jana seated comfortably in a warm, inviting space - perhaps near a window with plants visible. Gentle background music fades in.]*

**[Warm smile, direct eye contact with camera]**

"Hi, I'm Dr. Jana Rundle..."

---

### [0:05 - 0:20] PERSONAL INTRODUCTION
**[Leaning slightly forward, conversational tone]**

"...and if you're watching this, you might be feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, or maybe even wondering if what you're experiencing as a new mom is 'normal.'"

**[Gentle pause, understanding nod]**

"First, I want you to know—you're not alone, and reaching out takes incredible strength."

---

### [0:20 - 0:45] ADDRESSING THE VIEWER'S STATE
**[Softer voice, empathetic expression]**

"Maybe you're watching this at 3 AM while your baby sleeps, or stealing a moment between feedings. Perhaps you're feeling disconnected from yourself, anxious about being a 'good enough' mom, or struggling with feelings you didn't expect."

**[Slight pause, reassuring tone]**

"These experiences are more common than you might think. In fact, up to 20% of new mothers experience postpartum depression or anxiety—and many more face challenges they don't talk about."

---

### [0:45 - 1:10] BUILDING CREDIBILITY & CONNECTION
**[Straightening slightly, professional but warm]**

"I'm a licensed psychologist here in Austin, Texas, and I specialize in maternal mental health. But more than my credentials, what I bring to our work together is a deep understanding of the unique journey of motherhood."

**[Personal touch, gentle smile]**

"Every day, I have the privilege of supporting mothers like you—women who are navigating the beautiful complexity of new motherhood while trying to maintain their own sense of self."

---

### [1:10 - 1:35] UNDERSTANDING & VALIDATION
**[Hands gently clasped, authentic delivery]**

"I know that asking for help can feel scary. You might worry about being judged, or fear that admitting you're struggling means you're failing as a mother."

**[Firm but gentle, direct eye contact]**

"Let me be clear: seeking support is not a sign of weakness—it's an act of love, both for yourself and your baby. You deserve to feel like yourself again, to experience joy in motherhood, and to have support on this journey."

---

### [1:35 - 2:00] SERVICES INTRODUCTION
**[Slightly more upbeat, hopeful tone]**

"That's why I've designed multiple ways to support you, wherever you are in your journey. Whether you prefer the comfort of your own home, the convenience of virtual sessions, or the dedicated space of my office—we can work together in a way that fits your life."

**[Inclusive gesture]**

"Beyond individual therapy, I also offer courses and programs specifically designed for new moms, because sometimes healing happens beautifully in community with others who truly understand."

---

### [2:00 - 2:20] SOFT CALL TO ACTION
**[Leaning in slightly, encouraging tone]**

"If any of this resonates with you, I invite you to take a small step today. Whether that's booking a consultation, joining one of our programs, or simply learning more about what support could look like for you—you don't have to do this alone."

---

### [2:20 - 2:30+] CLOSING
**[Warm, sincere expression]**

"Remember, you are already a good mother. Seeking support doesn't change that—it enhances it. I'm here when you're ready, and I'd be honored to be part of your journey back to yourself."

**[Final warm smile, slight pause before ending]**

"Take care of yourself. You deserve it."

**[Fade to soft end screen with contact information]**
