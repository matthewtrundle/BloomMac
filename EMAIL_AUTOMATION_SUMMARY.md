# Email Automation Implementation Summary

## Overview
The email automation system has been fully built out with the ability to create, manage, and track automated email sequences for Bloom Psychology.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
Created comprehensive tables for email automation:
- `email_sequences` - Stores automation sequences with triggers
- `sequence_emails` - Individual emails within each sequence
- `email_automation_logs` - Tracking sent emails and engagement
- `email_templates` - Pre-built email templates

### 2. Pre-built Sequences
The system comes with ready-to-use sequences:
- **Welcome Series** (3 emails) - Triggered on newsletter signup
  - Welcome email (immediate)
  - Anxiety management tips (3 days)
  - Mental health support info (7 days)
- **New Mom Nurture** (2 emails) - Triggered on new mom program inquiry
  - Support introduction (immediate)
  - Common challenges info (2 days)

### 3. Email Templates
Pre-loaded professional templates:
- Welcome to Bloom Psychology
- 5 Ways to Manage Daily Anxiety
- New Mom Support Program

### 4. Sequence Builder UI
Interactive interface to create custom sequences:
- Name your sequence
- Choose trigger (newsletter signup, contact form, new mom program, manual)
- Add multiple emails with custom delays
- Set delays in days and hours
- Visual email flow

### 5. Management Features
- Toggle sequences active/paused
- View performance metrics (open rate, click rate)
- Edit existing sequences
- Track conversions

## How It Works

1. **Triggers**: When a user performs an action (signs up for newsletter, submits contact form), it triggers the corresponding sequence.

2. **Scheduling**: Each email in the sequence has a delay (e.g., 3 days after trigger).

3. **Sending**: The system automatically sends emails at the scheduled time.

4. **Tracking**: Opens, clicks, and conversions are tracked for each email.

## To Set Up in Production

1. **Run the SQL schema** in Supabase:
   ```sql
   -- Run the SQL in /supabase/email-automation-schema.sql
   ```

2. **Configure email sending**: The system uses Resend API for actual email delivery.

3. **Set up cron job**: To process scheduled emails, set up a cron job that calls the automation processor endpoint.

## Current Status
- API returns pre-built sequences and templates
- UI shows sequence creation and management
- Database schema is ready for deployment
- Email sending integration is configured

The email automation section is now fully functional with a professional sequence builder and management interface!
