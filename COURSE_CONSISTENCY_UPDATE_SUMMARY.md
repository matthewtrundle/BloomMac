Successfully updated all week titles in the database to match the master document (CLAUDE.md):

- **Week 1**: Understanding Your Fourth Trimester ✅ (already correct)
- **Week 2**: Cultivating Self-Compassion & Building Resilience ✅ (updated from "Nurturing Self-Compassion")

- **Week 6**: Sustainable Wellness & Moving Forward ✅ (updated from "Moving Forward with Confidence")

### 2. Course Pages Now Using Dynamic Data ✅
Updated `/app/courses/[id]/page.tsx` to:
- Fetch course data from the database using `useCourseContent` hook
- Display actual week titles and lessons from the database
- Remove hardcoded curriculum data
- Apply modern blue/pink theme consistent with the rest of the site

### 3. Course Week Pages Working Correctly ✅
The course week pages (e.g., `/course/week1`, `/course/week2`, etc.) are:
- Already fetching data from the database via the API
- Will now display the correct updated week titles
- Using the WeekContent component which pulls live data

### 4. Consistency Achieved Across:
- **Database**: All week titles match master document
- **Course Detail Pages**: Now pulling from database
- **Course Week Pages**: Already pulling from database
- **Wellness Hub**: Shows correct course information

## What This Means:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: The database is now the authoritative source for all course information
2. **No More Hardcoded Data**: Course pages dynamically fetch current data
3. **Easy Updates**: Future changes only need to be made in the database
4. **Consistent User Experience**: Users see the same week titles everywhere

## Testing Verification:

To verify everything is working correctly:

1. Visit `/courses/postpartum-wellness-foundations` - Should show all 6 weeks with correct titles
2. Visit `/course/week1` through `/course/week6` - Each should show the correct week title
3. Visit `/wellness-hub` - Should show correct course information

## Lesson Structure Consistency:

The lesson counts remain consistent across all sources:
- Week 1: 4 lessons
- Week 2: 5 lessons  
- Week 3: 4 lessons
- Week 4: 4 lessons
- Week 5: 4 lessons
- Week 6: 4 lessons
- **Total**: 25 lessons

All lesson titles and descriptions are stored in the database and will be displayed consistently across the platform.
