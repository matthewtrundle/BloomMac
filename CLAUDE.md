## üõë DATABASE SCHEMA & CRITICAL RULES

### CURRENT DATABASE TABLES (Last Updated: Jan 2025):

| Table Name | Purpose | Key Info | Critical Notes |
|------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **email_templates** | Email template storage | 1 row | id, name, subject, content, category, variables (jsonb) |
| **email_sequences** | Email automation sequences | 2 active: newsletter_signup, contact_form | trigger, status, name |
| **sequence_emails** | Individual emails in sequences | 8 rows | position, subject, content, delays |
| **sequence_enrollments** | User enrollments in sequences | 37 rows | subscriber_id, current_position, status |
| **subscribers** | Newsletter/email subscribers | 46 rows | **NO `subscribed` COLUMN - USE `status`** |
| **user_profiles** | ALL user profiles (including admins) | 6 rows | **NO EMAIL COLUMN - email is in auth.users** |
| **contact_submissions** | Contact form submissions | 24 rows | |
| **courses** | Course definitions | 3 rows | |
| **course_modules** | Course week/module structure | 12 rows | |
| **course_lessons** | Individual lessons | 49 rows | |
| **email_automation_logs** | Email send history | 96 rows | |
| **analytics_events** | Site analytics | 4,409 rows | |

### STRICT RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:
1. **NEVER** assume a column exists - ALWAYS verify first
2. **NEVER** create mock/fake data - USE REAL DATA from database
3. **NEVER** guess table names - USE THE LIST ABOVE
4. **NEVER** make up API responses - QUERY THE DATABASE
5. **ALWAYS** query before assuming structure

### Common Mistakes That Keep Happening:
- Assuming `subscribed` column exists (IT DOESN'T - use `status`)
- Creating fake email analytics data
- Making up template structures
- Assuming table relationships without checking

### Key Schema Details:

#### `subscribers` table:
- `status` (varchar) - VALUES: 'active', 'unsubscribed', 'pending'
- `source` (varchar) - signup source
- **NO `subscribed` COLUMN - USE `status`**

#### `user_profiles` table:
- `role` field: 'admin', 'student', 'provider'
- **NO EMAIL COLUMN - email is in auth.users**
- Must JOIN with auth.users to get email

#### `user_preferences` table:
- `privacy_settings` (jsonb) - contains contact_visibility, profile_visibility
- `notification_preferences` (jsonb)
- `communication_preferences` (jsonb)

## üîß ESSENTIAL COMMANDS & TESTING

### Before ANY Database Work:
```bash
# Check database state - MANDATORY
npm run db:check

# Validate schema
npm run db:validate

# Query specific table
npm run db:query "SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 5"

# Test all queries
npm run db:test
```

### Database Access Methods:
```bash
# Check if table exists and row count
node -e "
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
require('dotenv').config({ path: '.env.local' });
const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY);
supabase.from('table_name').select('count', { count: 'exact', head: true })
  .then(({count, error}) => console.log('table_name:', error ? 'Does not exist' : count + ' rows'));
"
```

### MANDATORY WORKFLOW - DO THIS AUTOMATICALLY:

| User Says | You MUST Run |
|-----------|--------------|
| "add [feature]" | `npm run db:check` then test queries |
| "why is [X] not working" | `npm run db:query` on the failing query |
| "show all [X]" | `npm run db:query "SELECT * FROM [table] LIMIT 5"` |
| "subscribers" | Verify columns first with `npm run db:check` |
| "email" | `npm run db:check \| grep email` |

**ENFORCEMENT**: If you write database code without showing test results first, the code WILL have bugs.

## üî¥ AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY

### Current Authentication System (Jan 2025)

**THE APP USES ONE USER TABLE WITH ROLE-BASED ACCESS:**
- **`user_profiles`** - For ALL users (admin and regular)
- Auth method: Supabase Auth + JWT tokens for admin routes
- **THERE IS NO `admin_users` TABLE!**
- Admin access controlled by `role = 'admin'` in user_profiles

### How Admin Login Works:
1. User submits email/password to `/api/admin/auth/login`
2. Authenticates with Supabase Auth (auth.users table)
3. Checks if user has `role = 'admin'` in `user_profiles` table
4. Creates JWT token AND Supabase session
5. Sets 3 cookies: adminToken, sb-access-token, sb-refresh-token

### üö® CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

**Status**: 20 tables with RLS (Row Level Security) disabled, exposing data to unauthorized access

#### Tables with Policies but RLS DISABLED (8 tables):
- `analytics_events`, `blog_posts`, `career_applications`, `contact_submissions`
- `courses`, `email_queue`, `email_templates`, `subscribers`

#### Quick Fix for Critical Tables:
```sql
-- Enable RLS on tables with existing policies (safe to run immediately)
ALTER TABLE public.analytics_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.contact_submissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.courses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.subscribers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### HIPAA Compliance Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT COMPLIANT
- ‚ùå No encryption at rest for database
- ‚ùå No audit logs for data access
- ‚ùå No BAAs with Supabase/Resend/Vercel
- **NEVER store PHI in current system**
- **Use Calendly for appointments** (they handle HIPAA)

## üìß EMAIL AUTOMATION SYSTEM

### PRODUCTION EMAIL SEQUENCES:

| Trigger | Status | Emails | Entry Point |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `newsletter_signup` | ‚úÖ WORKING | 5 emails (30 days) | Profile settings, newsletter page |
| `contact_form` | ‚úÖ WORKING | 3 emails (7 days) | Contact form submissions |
| `resource_download` | üóÉÔ∏è ARCHIVED | N/A | Resource pages are free content |
| `new_mom_program` | üóÉÔ∏è ARCHIVED | N/A | Calendly bookings |

### How It Works:
1. **Trigger Event**: User action (newsletter signup, contact form)
2. **enrollmentManager.enrollSubscriber()**: Creates enrollment record
3. **Cron Job**: `/api/cron/process-email-sequences/route.ts` runs every hour
4. **Email Processor**: Sends via Resend, updates enrollment status

### Key Files:
- `/lib/email-automation/enrollment-manager.ts` - Core enrollment logic
- `/app/api/cron/process-email-sequences/route.ts` - Email processor
- `/app/api/user/newsletter-subscribe/route.ts` - Working example

### Enrollment Manager API:
```javascript
await enrollmentManager.enrollSubscriber({
  subscriberId: 'uuid',
  trigger: 'newsletter_signup', // Must match email_sequences.trigger
  source: 'profile_settings'
});
```

### Testing Commands:
```bash
# Check sequence status
node scripts/check-pending-emails.js

# Test processor manually
node scripts/test-sequence-processor.js
```

## üìö COURSE & DESIGN STANDARDS

### Course Structure: Postpartum Wellness Foundations (6 Weeks)
**Instructor**: Dr. Jana Rundle - Licensed Psychologist, Certified Perinatal Mental Health Specialist

#### Week Structure:
- **Week 1**: Understanding Your Fourth Trimester (4 lessons)
- **Week 2**: Cultivating Self-Compassion & Building Resilience (5 lessons)
- **Week 3**: Building Your Support Ecosystem (4 lessons)
- **Week 4**: Understanding & Managing Postpartum Anxiety (4 lessons)
- **Week 5**: Identity Integration & Matrescence (4 lessons)
- **Week 6**: Sustainable Wellness & Moving Forward (4 lessons)

**Status**: Week 1 complete, Week 2 scripts complete, Weeks 3-6 planned.

### üéØ DR. JANA'S VOICE & SCRIPT DEVELOPMENT

**CRITICAL**: For ALL script development (meditation scripts, course content, video scripts), you MUST reference:

**`DR-JANA-VOICE-TRANSCRIPT-ANALYSIS.md`** - Comprehensive analysis of Dr. Jana's authentic speaking patterns, language choices, and therapeutic approach

This document contains:
- Permission-giving language patterns ("You have the right to...")
- Validation and normalization techniques
- Both/and thinking integration
- Scientific explanation style
- Biological wisdom framing
- ElevenLabs voice engineering tags
- Week-specific voice guidance for meditation scripts

**NEVER create scripts without first consulting this analysis document to ensure authentic Dr. Jana voice alignment.**

### üé® COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN SYSTEM & STANDARDS

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL** - All Bloom course presentations MUST follow sophisticated, magazine-quality design that creates emotionally intelligent educational experiences.

#### üìã Primary Design Documentation (MUST REFERENCE):

1. **`/bloom-course-content/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`** - Core design system foundation
2. **`/bloom-course-content/PRESENTATION-DESIGN-GUIDE.md`** - Advanced implementation guide
3. **`/bloom-course-content/weeks/week-1-foundation/PRESENTATION-TEMPLATE-GUIDE.md`** - Template specifics
4. **`/public/presentations/week1/assets/css/bloom-professional.css`** - Reference CSS implementation

#### üö® CRITICAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

##### Typography Foundation:
```css
--font-display: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif;     /* Headlines - REQUIRED */
--font-body: 'Inter', -apple-system, sans-serif; /* Body text - REQUIRED */

/* Responsive sizing with clamp() - MANDATORY */
h1: clamp(3.5rem, 7vw, 6rem);
h2: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem);
body: clamp(1rem, 2vw, 1.3rem);
```

##### Required Visual Architecture:
1. **Hero Slides** - Full-bleed images with gradient scrims and text protection
2. **Magazine Layouts** - Asymmetric grids (60/40 or 3fr/2fr) NOT basic centering
3. **Glass Morphism** - Cards with `backdrop-filter: blur()` and sophisticated shadows
4. **Depth System** - Multi-layer shadows, overlapping elements, visual hierarchy
5. **Gradient Meshes** - Background visual interest without overwhelming content
6. **Color Journey** - Strategic emotional progression through slide sequence

##### Strategic Color Psychology (USE FULL PALETTE):
- **Sage (#8B9A82)**: Grounding, wisdom, professional authority
- **Coral (#FF6B6B)**: Urgency, importance, vulnerability moments
- **Golden (#FFCB77)**: Hope, transformation, achievement
- **Lavender (#C589E8)**: Transformation, spirituality, deeper work
- **Mint (#95E1D3)**: Freshness, clarity, new beginnings
- **Rose (#FFA8C5)**: Compassion, self-love, nurturing

#### üéØ Design Implementation Process:

##### Step 1: Foundation Setup
- Import proper fonts (Google Fonts CDN)
- Implement full color palette as CSS variables
- Set up responsive typography with clamp()
- Create base layout containers with CSS Grid/Flexbox

##### Step 2: Layout Excellence
- Use magazine-quality layouts (study Vogue, Harper's Bazaar layouts)
- Implement visual hierarchy with varied card sizes and positioning
- Add depth through multiple shadow layers and element overlap
- Create asymmetric, dynamic compositions that guide the eye

##### Step 3: Visual Polish
- Add gradient mesh backgrounds where appropriate
- Implement glass morphism for floating cards and overlays
- Create sophisticated hover states with smooth transitions
- Polish fragment timing for storytelling rhythm

##### Step 4: Emotional Design Mapping
- Map colors to content emotional journey
- Progress from vulnerability (coral/sage) ‚Üí transformation (lavender) ‚Üí hope (golden/mint)
- Use visual metaphors that support content themes
- Ensure every design choice has psychological purpose

#### üö´ DESIGN RED FLAGS (IMMEDIATE REDESIGN REQUIRED):

- **Basic Centered Layouts** - Everything centered with flexbox
- **Limited Color Usage** - Only 3-4 colors instead of full strategic palette
- **Missing Visual Effects** - No glass morphism, depth shadows, or gradient meshes
- **Poor Typography** - Not using Cormorant Garamond or responsive scaling
- **No Hover States** - Static presentations without interactive feedback
- **Flat Design** - No depth, layering, or visual hierarchy
- **Text Readability Issues** - Poor contrast over images
- **Same Layout Pattern** - Repetitive slide structures without variety

#### ‚úÖ Quality Checklist (ALL MUST BE MET):

- [ ] Uses Cormorant Garamond for display typography
- [ ] Implements responsive sizing with clamp() functions
- [ ] Features magazine-quality asymmetric layouts
- [ ] Includes glass morphism effects where appropriate
- [ ] Has sophisticated multi-layer shadow system
- [ ] Colors support emotional journey progression
- [ ] Images follow selection guidelines (warm, hopeful, diverse)
- [ ] Text is readable on every slide with proper contrast
- [ ] Hover states work smoothly with CSS transitions
- [ ] Animations enhance storytelling without distraction
- [ ] Exports cleanly to PDF for offline viewing

#### üìç Reference Implementations:

**Gold Standard Examples**:
- `/bloom-course-content/weeks/week-1-foundation/lesson-1-welcome/presentation.html`
- `/bloom-course-content/weeks/week-1-foundation/lesson-2-normal-vs-not/presentation.html`

**Study These for Layout Patterns**:
- Hero slide implementations with gradient scrims
- Magazine layout with asymmetric content placement
- Glass card implementations with backdrop blur
- Color journey progression through slide sequence

#### üõ†Ô∏è Design Audit Process:

Before considering any presentation complete:

1. **Visual Scan**: Does it look like a professional magazine spread?
2. **Color Check**: Are all 6 strategic colors being used purposefully?
3. **Typography Test**: Is Cormorant Garamond prominent and readable?
4. **Layout Variety**: Are there at least 3 different layout patterns?
5. **Emotional Journey**: Does the color progression support the content arc?
6. **Interactive Polish**: Do hover states and transitions feel smooth?

#### üí° Design Philosophy:

These presentations honor the complexity and beauty of the postpartum journey. Every design choice should:
1. **Support emotional narrative** - Design follows content themes
2. **Create visual interest** - Varied layouts prevent monotony  
3. **Maintain professional polish** - Magazine-quality execution
4. **Enhance understanding** - Visual hierarchy guides comprehension
5. **Respect viewer intelligence** - Sophisticated without being overwhelming

**REMEMBER**: If a presentation doesn't meet these standards, it's not ready for production. The design system ensures every mother receives a world-class educational experience that matches the caliber of Dr. Jana's expertise.

## üö® HALLUCINATION PREVENTION & CONTEXT PRESERVATION

### Red Flags That Should Trigger Re-verification:
- "I'll create some example..." ‚Üí NO! Query real data
- "Typically, this would..." ‚Üí NO! Check actual implementation
- "It should have..." ‚Üí NO! Verify what it actually has

### Memory Limitations:
- **AI WILL FORGET** - After ~10 messages, context may be lost
- **SOLUTION**: Always re-verify assumptions with database checks
- **NEVER** rely on information from earlier in conversation without re-checking

### Every 5 Operations:
1. Re-run `npm run db:check`
2. Re-validate assumptions
3. Update this file with discoveries

## üõ†Ô∏è DATABASE ACCESS LIMITATIONS

### Current Limitations:
**DNS Issue**: Cannot resolve `db.utetcmirepwdxbtrcczv.supabase.co` from this environment
- ‚ùå `psql` direct connection fails
- ‚ùå `pg` Node.js client fails  
- ‚úÖ Supabase JS client works

### For Schema Changes:
- **Cannot execute DDL via JS client** (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
- **Must use Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor**
- Generate validated `.sql` files first
- Always verify current state before changes

## üö® ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
