# Survey Implementation & Deployment Plan

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Survey Platform Options

#### Option A: Google Forms (Recommended for Quick Launch)
- **Pros**: Free, easy analytics, automatic response collection
- **Cons**: Less customizable, Google branding
- **Setup Time**: 2 hours

#### Option B: Typeform
- **Pros**: Beautiful UX, conditional logic, integrations
- **Cons**: Paid ($29/month), limited responses on free tier
- **Setup Time**: 3 hours

#### Option C: Custom Next.js Implementation
- **Pros**: Full control, branded experience, direct to database
- **Cons**: Development time, hosting costs
- **Setup Time**: 8-10 hours

### 2. Response Tracking Database Schema

```sql
-- Survey responses table
CREATE TABLE theme_survey_responses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  survey_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'expert' or 'mother'
  respondent_email VARCHAR(255),
  responses JSONB NOT NULL,
  theme_rankings JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  ip_address INET,
  completion_time INTEGER, -- seconds
  referral_source VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Compensation tracking
CREATE TABLE survey_compensation (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  respondent_email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  survey_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP,
  gift_card_code VARCHAR(100),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending'

### 5. Response Analysis Plan

```javascript
// Sample analysis queries

// 1. Theme preference by audience
SELECT 
  theme_name,
  survey_type,
  COUNT(*) as votes,
  AVG(overall_score) as avg_score
FROM theme_rankings
GROUP BY theme_name, survey_type
ORDER BY avg_score DESC;

// 2. Emotional response analysis
SELECT 
  theme_name,
  emotion,
  COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM emotional_responses
WHERE survey_type = 'mother'
GROUP BY theme_name, emotion
ORDER BY frequency DESC;

// 3. Conversion potential (experts only)
SELECT 
  theme_name,
  AVG(conversion_score) as avg_conversion,
  AVG(usability_score) as avg_usability,
  AVG(trust_score) as avg_trust
FROM expert_assessments
GROUP BY theme_name;
```

### 6. Automated Compensation System

```javascript
// API endpoint for processing compensation
app.post('/api/survey/complete', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, surveyType, responses } = req.body;
  
  // Save responses
  const responseId = await saveSurveyResponse(email, surveyType, responses);
  
  // Queue compensation
  await queueCompensation({
    email,
    surveyType,
    amount: surveyType === 'expert' ? 50 : 25,
    responseId
  });
  
  // Send confirmation email
  await sendEmail({
    to: email,
    template: 'survey-complete',
    data: {
      giftCardAmount: surveyType === 'expert' ? 50 : 25,
      deliveryTime: '24-48 hours'
    }
  });
  
  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

### 7. Real-time Dashboard

Create admin dashboard at `/admin/survey-results` showing:
- Response count by survey type
- Theme rankings in real-time
- Word cloud of emotional responses
- Demographic breakdown
- Completion rate tracking
- Average time to complete

### 8. A/B Testing Preparation

If results are close, prepare for A/B testing:
```javascript
// Middleware for theme A/B testing
export function themeABTest(req, res, next) {
  // Get or set user's test group
  let testGroup = req.cookies.themeTest;
  
  if (!testGroup) {
    testGroup = Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'A' : 'B';
    res.cookie('themeTest', testGroup, { 
      maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 30 days
    });
  }
  
  req.themeVersion = testGroup;
  next();
}
```
