# HIPAA Compliance Assessment - Bloom Psychology

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Current Status - NOT HIPAA COMPLIANT

### Executive Summary

The Bloom Psychology website is currently **NOT HIPAA compliant** and should not be used to store, process, or transmit any Protected Health Information (PHI) including:
- Patient names with health conditions
- Appointment details with diagnoses
- Treatment notes
- Insurance information
- Any combination of identifiers + health information

### üî¥ Immediate Recommendations

1. **Continue using Calendly** for appointment scheduling (they handle HIPAA compliance)
2. **Do NOT store patient health information** in the current database
3. **Keep email content generic** - no health details in automated emails
4. **Use a HIPAA-compliant EHR system** for clinical notes

### üìä Compliance Gap Analysis

| HIPAA Requirement | Current Status | Required Actions |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)** | ‚ùå None in place | Need BAAs with Supabase, Resend, Vercel |
| **Encryption at Rest** | ‚ùå Not implemented | Database encryption required |
| **Encryption in Transit** | ‚úÖ HTTPS enabled | Already compliant |
| **Access Controls** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic only | Need MFA, session timeouts |
| **Audit Logs** | ‚ùå Not implemented | Must log all PHI access |
| **Data Backup** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unencrypted | Encrypted backups required |
| **Breach Notification** | ‚ùå No process | Incident response plan needed |
| **Minimum Necessary** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Separate PHI from marketing data |

### üí∞ Cost Implications

#### Option 1: Make Current Stack Compliant
- **Supabase Enterprise**: ~$2,500/month (includes BAA)
- **HIPAA-compliant email**: ~$100-300/month
- **Audit logging service**: ~$200/month
- **Security assessment**: ~$5,000-10,000 one-time
- **Total**: ~$3,000/month + setup costs

#### Option 2: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- **Keep current system** for marketing/website
- **Use SimplePractice or similar** for PHI (~$70/month)
- **Minimal integration** between systems
- **Total**: ~$70/month

### üõ°Ô∏è Safe Email Automation Patterns

#### ‚úÖ HIPAA-Safe Examples:
```
"Hi Sarah, this is a reminder that you have an appointment tomorrow at 2 PM. 
Please call us at 512-898-9510 if you need to reschedule."
```

#### ‚ùå NOT HIPAA-Safe Examples:
```
"Hi Sarah, this is a reminder about your anxiety therapy session tomorrow at 2 PM.
Don't forget to bring your depression screening results."
```

### üìã Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Immediate (Do Now)
1. Add disclaimer to contact forms: "Please do not include health information"
2. Review all email templates for PHI
3. Document what data is stored where
4. Create data handling policies

#### Phase 2: Short-term (1-3 months)
1. Implement basic audit logging
2. Add session timeouts
3. Create incident response plan
4. Staff HIPAA training

#### Phase 3: Long-term (3-6 months)
1. Evaluate HIPAA-compliant platforms
2. Implement proper PHI separation
3. Obtain necessary BAAs
4. Conduct security assessment

### üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Schedule a consultation** with a HIPAA compliance expert
2. **Choose an EHR system** that's already HIPAA compliant
3. **Keep the website** for marketing and general practice information
4. **Use compliant third-party services** for anything involving PHI

### üìö Key HIPAA Concepts for Development

- **PHI (Protected Health Information)**: Any health info + identifier
- **Minimum Necessary**: Only access/share what's needed
- **BAA (Business Associate Agreement)**: Legal contract with vendors
- **Technical Safeguards**: Encryption, access controls, audit logs
- **Administrative Safeguards**: Policies, training, risk assessments

**Remember**: HIPAA violations can result in fines from $100 to $2 million per violation. When in doubt, keep PHI out of the current system.
