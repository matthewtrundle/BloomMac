const { data, error } = await supabase
  .storage
  .createBucket('audio', {
    public: true,
    fileSizeLimit: 104857600, // 100MB
    allowedMimeTypes: ['audio/mpeg', 'audio/mp3', 'audio/wav', 'audio/m4a']
  });
```

### For Cost Optimization (Future Migration)
**Migrate to Cloudflare R2** when:
- Monthly bandwidth exceeds 200GB
- Need predictable costs without bandwidth charges
- Want to reduce operational costs

### For Premium Content Strategy
**Add Transistor.fm** for:
- Curated meditation series as private podcasts
- Subscription-based premium content
- Professional distribution to podcast apps
- Building audience through podcast directories

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Start with Supabase (Immediate)
- Leverage existing infrastructure
- No additional vendor management
- Test audio delivery performance
- Monitor bandwidth usage

### 2. Plan for R2 Migration (3-6 months)
- Set up when bandwidth costs become significant
- Use S3-compatible API for easy migration
- Maintain Supabase for small files, R2 for audio

### 3. Consider Transistor for Premium (6+ months)
- Launch premium meditation series
- Create private podcast feeds for course participants
- Distribute through podcast ecosystem

## Technical Integration Examples

### Supabase Audio Player Integration
```jsx
const AudioPlayer = ({ filePath }) => {
  const [url, setUrl] = useState('');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const { data } = supabase.storage
      .from('audio')
      .getPublicUrl(filePath);
    setUrl(data.publicUrl);
  }, [filePath]);
  
  return (
    <audio controls preload="metadata">
      <source src={url} type="audio/mpeg" />
    </audio>
  );
};
```

### Security Considerations
1. **For Free Content:** Use public buckets with CDN caching
2. **For Course Content:** Use signed URLs with expiration
3. **For Premium Content:** Consider Transistor's private podcast feeds
4. **Analytics:** Implement custom tracking or use provider analytics

## Cost Projection (Monthly)

### Scenario: 50 meditation files, 10,000 plays/month (~500GB bandwidth)

1. **AWS S3 + CloudFront:** ~$42.50
2. **Cloudflare R2:** ~$0.75 (storage only)
3. **Vercel Blob:** ~$45.00
4. **Bunny.net:** ~$9.50
