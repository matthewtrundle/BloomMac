feat(wellness-hub): Refactor pages to use modern Supabase client

This commit resolves critical authentication and component initialization errors across the Wellness Hub by refactoring key pages to use the modern, client-side Supabase library (`createClientComponentClient`).

The primary issue stemmed from legacy data-fetching patterns (`useAuth` context, direct `fetch` calls to internal APIs) that were incompatible with the recently unified authentication system. This resulted in 401 Unauthorized errors and prevented components like Calendly from initializing correctly.

Key changes:
- Replaced `useAuth` and `useSupabaseClient` with `createClientComponentClient` in the following pages:
  - `app/profile/edit/page.tsx`
  - `app/settings/page.tsx`
  - `app/appointments/page.tsx`
- Removed intermediate API calls by interacting with the Supabase backend directly from the client-side components.
- This resolves authentication failures and ensures all components receive the necessary data and context to function correctly.
- Added a comprehensive `TESTING_GUIDE.md` to standardize the E2E testing process.
- Cleaned up the repository by removing numerous obsolete `.backup` files and legacy authentication modules.
