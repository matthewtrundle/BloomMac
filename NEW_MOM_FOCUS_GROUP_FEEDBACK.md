## Individual Feedback Highlights

### Sarah (Anxiety Mom):
"The intrusive thoughts normalization is HUGE. I thought I was going insane when I kept imagining dropping my baby. But I need more on the physical anxiety symptoms - the chest tightness, the can't-breathe feeling at 2 AM. And please, PLEASE talk about how anxiety makes you feel like a fraud mom."

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. Immediate anxiety relief techniques (not 20-minute meditations)
2. Scripts for telling partner "I'm not okay"
3. How to function on no sleep with anxiety

### Maria (Rage Mom):
"THANK YOU for adding rage! I screamed into a pillow yesterday and felt like a monster. We need to talk about wanting to throw the baby monitor against the wall, fantasizing about running away, and the guilt spiral after you lose it. And touched out - being touched out is REAL."

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. Rage as a valid emotion + safe expression
2. How to repair after you've snapped
3. Setting boundaries when you have nothing left

### Ashley (Single Mom):
"Everything assumes you have a partner. I need content for 'when it's just you at 3 AM and the baby won't stop crying and you haven't showered in 5 days.' The support system stuff made me cry because I don't have one. Can we talk about building support from scratch?"

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. Single parent survival strategies
2. Building support when you have none
3. Government resources and practical help

### Priya (NICU Mom):
"Birth trauma needs its own week, honestly. I'm still processing watching my baby on ventilators. The 'normal' postpartum content doesn't fit when your baby almost died. And the guilt - survivor's guilt when other NICU babies don't make it."

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. PTSD from birth/NICU specific content
2. Bonding after medical trauma
3. How to cope with medical anxiety

### Jessica (Working Mom):
"That return to work module is critical. I cried in the bathroom every day for two weeks. We need real talk about pumping in gross bathrooms, missing milestones, and colleagues who say 'must be nice to have had a vacation.' And negotiating flexibility without mommy-tracking yourself."

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. Practical return-to-work transition
2. Maintaining mental health while working
3. Guilt management strategies

### Keisha (Twin Mom):
"Everything is harder with multiples. I'm barely surviving, not thriving. I need 'how to keep two babies alive when you're hallucinating from exhaustion' not 'practice self-care.' And the logistics - just the LOGISTICS of twins is insane."

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. Multiples-specific survival strategies
2. When you literally cannot sleep
3. Asking for help without shame

### Emma (Long-term Struggler):
"14 months and I'm still not 'better.' Everything talks about 6-12 month recovery but what about those of us still drowning after a year? And now I'm terrified of getting pregnant again but feel guilty about only having one."

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. Long-term recovery (past 12 months)
2. Subsequent pregnancy fears
3. When to accept this is your new normal

### Lin (Cultural Pressure Mom):
"My mother-in-law keeps telling me Western mothers are weak, that her generation just got on with it. The cultural piece is huge - how do you set boundaries when your culture says elders are always right? And the shame of needing therapy in my community..."

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. Navigating cultural expectations
2. Setting boundaries respectfully
3. Dealing with intergenerational trauma

## Group Discussion Themes

### On Postpartum Rage:
- **Maria**: "It's not just anger, it's RAGE. Like, primal. I scared myself."
- **Ashley**: "Yes! And it's worse when you're alone because there's no one to tag in."
- **Emma**: "The rage comes back. I thought I was over it at 6 months, but it cycles."
- **GROUP CONSENSUS**: Need rage normalization, safe expression techniques, and repair strategies

### On Medication:
- **Sarah**: "I was terrified to take meds while breastfeeding but I was literally dying inside."
- **Jessica**: "My psychiatrist said 'your mental health matters too' and I cried."
- **Lin**: "My family shamed me for 'drugging' myself. We need cultural medication stigma addressed."
- **GROUP CONSENSUS**: Clear, non-judgmental medication information with breastfeeding data

### On Physical Recovery:
- **Priya**: "Can we acknowledge that some of us are dealing with serious physical trauma?"
- **Keisha**: "Yes, but keep it brief. I don't need detailed bleeding talk when I'm already anxious."
- **Maria**: "Maybe just validate that physical recovery affects mental health?"
- **GROUP CONSENSUS**: Brief acknowledgment, not graphic details

### On Support Systems:
- **Ashley**: "Stop assuming everyone has a village. Some of us have nobody."
- **Lin**: "Or your 'village' makes it worse with their judgments."
- **Emma**: "Can we talk about how to fire your support system when they're toxic?"
- **GROUP CONSENSUS**: How to build support from nothing AND set boundaries with unhelpful support

### On Coping Strategies:
- **Keisha**: "I need 30-second strategies, not 30-minute ones."
- **Sarah**: "The breathing thing works but only if I remember to do it."
- **Jessica**: "Honestly? Sometimes wine and Netflix IS self-care."
- **Maria**: "Can we be honest that sometimes coping is just surviving another hour?"
- **GROUP CONSENSUS**: Micro-coping strategies, survival mode tactics, realistic self-care

## Facilitator Note:
The session was emotional, with multiple moms crying during discussions of rage, isolation, and feeling "broken." The solidarity in the group was powerful - they repeatedly validated each other and pushed back against sanitized narratives of motherhood. Their hunger for honest, practical, inclusive content was palpable. They want instructors who've "been in the trenches," not just studied them.
