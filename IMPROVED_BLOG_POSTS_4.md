## The Maternal Mental Health Crisis Nobody's Talking About

*May 9, 2025 • 7 min read*

The statistics stopped me cold: Maternal suicide is now a leading cause of death in the first year postpartum.

Let that sink in.

While we celebrate baby's first steps and first words, mothers are silently drowning. And the pandemic? It turned a crisis into a catastrophe.

### The Numbers We Can't Ignore

The latest CDC data is sobering:
- 1 in 5 new mothers experience a perinatal mood disorder
- Rates doubled during the pandemic
- 75% never receive treatment
- Maternal suicide accounts for 20% of postpartum deaths

But statistics don't capture the 3 AM panic attacks, the disconnection from your baby, or the crushing guilt of not feeling "blessed."

### Why It's Getting Worse

**The Isolation Factor**
Remember "it takes a village"? Most moms don't have one. We parent in boxes—literal suburban boxes—often far from family, without community support.

**The Comparison Trap**
Social media shows highlight reels while you're living the behind-the-scenes chaos. Everyone else looks happy. You must be broken.

**The Healthcare Gap**
Six-week postpartum checkup. That's it. Then you're on your own. As if healing happens on a medical timeline.

**The Cultural Pressure**
"Breast is best!" "Sleep train!" "Don't sleep train!" "Cherish every moment!" The shoulds are drowning out the support.

### What Mothers Are Really Experiencing

I asked moms to share their truth. Here's what they said:

"I fantasized about getting in a car accident. Not dying, just hurt enough to rest in a hospital." - Anonymous

"I loved my baby but felt nothing. Like I was babysitting someone else's child." - Rachel

"The rage scared me. I'd never felt anger like that before." - Maria

"Everyone asked about the baby. No one asked about me." - Sarah

### The Hidden Symptoms

We know about sadness and anxiety. But what about:

**Maternal OCD**
Intrusive thoughts about harm coming to baby. Checking breathing obsessively. Unable to trust anyone with your child.

**Postpartum Rage**
The anger nobody warns you about. Fury at your partner, your situation, yourself.

**Birth Trauma**
When delivery doesn't go as planned. When you don't feel heard. When your body feels betrayed.

**Identity Grief**
Mourning who you were. Wondering if you'll ever feel like "you" again.

### Breaking the Silence

Here's what needs to change:

**Universal Screening**
Not just at 6 weeks. Ongoing. Partners included.

**Accessible Treatment**
Therapy that works with baby schedules. Telehealth options. Sliding scales.

**Community Support**
Real villages. Mom groups that go beyond playdates. Partners who get educated.

**Honest Conversations**
Permission to say "this is hard" without feeling ungrateful.

### What's Actually Helping

Programs that are making a difference:

**Peer Support Networks**
Moms who've been there, trained to help others. No judgment, just understanding.

**Intensive Day Programs**
Treatment that doesn't separate mom and baby. Real help, not just medication.

**Partner Education**
Teaching partners to recognize symptoms, provide support, seek help.

**Cultural Shift**
Slowly, we're normalizing the struggle. Making it okay to not be okay.

### The Path Forward

If you're reading this and recognizing yourself:

1. **You're not alone** - Even if it feels that way
2. **You're not weak** - Asking for help is brave
3. **You will get better** - With proper support
4. **Your feelings are valid** - All of them

### When to Sound the Alarm

Get help immediately if you:
- Have thoughts of harming yourself or baby
- Feel disconnected from reality
- Can't care for yourself or baby
- Have a plan to hurt yourself
- Feel hopeless about the future

### The Hope Part

Here's what I know after years of treating maternal mental health: Recovery is possible. Real recovery. Not just surviving, but thriving.

With proper treatment:
- The fog lifts
- Connection returns
- Joy creeps back in
- You find yourself again (often a stronger version)

### What Needs to Happen

**For Society:**
- Paid family leave
- Affordable childcare
- Better healthcare coverage
- Community support systems

**For Healthcare:**
- Regular mental health screening
- Integrated care teams
- Accessible treatment options
- Provider education

**For Families:**
- Open conversations
- Shared responsibilities
- Extended support
- Destigmatization

### Your Part in the Solution

If you're not struggling, you can still help:
- Check on new moms regularly
- Offer specific help ("I'm bringing dinner Tuesday")
- Listen without judging
- Share this information
- Advocate for better policies

### The Bottom Line

The maternal mental health crisis is real, it's devastating, and it's treatable. We need to stop pretending that struggling means failing.

At Bloom, we're part of the solution. Specialized treatment, peer support, partner education—we're working to change the narrative and save lives.

Because every mother deserves support. Every mother deserves healing. Every mother deserves to thrive, not just survive.

If you're struggling, reach out. Today. Your life matters. Your mental health matters. You matter.

And to society: It's time we started acting like it.

## Postpartum Rage: The Symptom We Don't Talk About

*March 14, 2025 • 6 min read*

"I scared myself yesterday."

Jennifer's voice was barely a whisper. "The baby wouldn't stop crying, my toddler was having a meltdown, and I just... exploded. I screamed. Really screamed. Then I locked myself in the bathroom and sobbed."

If you're nodding along, feeling that familiar shame—this is for you.

### The Anger Nobody Mentions

We talk about postpartum depression. We whisper about anxiety. But rage? That's the symptom hidden in shame, locked away in bathroom cries and car screams.

Yet it's incredibly common. Up to 1 in 5 women with postpartum mood disorders experience significant anger or rage.

### What Postpartum Rage Actually Looks Like

**The Explosion**
Zero to fury in seconds. Over spilled milk. Over a crying baby. Over nothing at all.

**The Physical Response**
Clenched jaw. Tight chest. Shaking hands. The urge to throw something (or actually throwing it).

**The Immediate Aftermath**
Crushing guilt. Deep shame. Fear: "What's wrong with me?"

**The Cycle**
Promise yourself it won't happen again. Feel the pressure build. Explode. Repeat.

### Why Rage Shows Up Postpartum

**Sleep Deprivation**
Your brain on no sleep is a brain primed for fight-or-flight. Guess which one wins when you can't flight?

**Hormonal Chaos**
Estrogen crash + progesterone plummet + cortisol spike = emotional powder keg.

**Overstimulation**
Crying baby. Toddler needs. Constant touching. Noise. Your nervous system is maxed out.

**Loss of Control**
Used to managing your life? Welcome to chaos you can't control. Cue frustration turning to rage.

**Unmet Needs**
Haven't eaten. Haven't showered. Haven't peed alone. Basic needs unmet = emotional dysregulation.

### The Shame Spiral

"Good moms don't get angry."
"I'm damaging my children."
"I'm turning into my mother."
"They'd be better off without me."

Stop. These thoughts are lying to you.

### What Your Rage Is Telling You

Anger is a messenger. It's saying:
- Your needs matter too
- You're overwhelmed
- You need support
- Something needs to change
- You're human, not superhuman

### Real Moms, Real Stories

"I threw a water bottle at the wall. My toddler said, 'Mommy, are you having big feelings?' I realized I was modeling what I'd taught him—that feelings are okay, even big ones." - Sarah

"I started warning my family: 'I'm at capacity. I need space.' Now they know to back off before I explode." - Maria

"I thought I was a monster. My therapist helped me see I was just a depleted human being." - Ashley

### Breaking the Rage Cycle

**Immediate Strategies:**
- Step outside (yes, even if baby's crying)
- Splash cold water on your face
- Scream into a pillow
- Do 10 jumping jacks
- Put baby in safe place, walk away

**Daily Prevention:**
- Tag team with partner
- Eat regularly (seriously)
- Lower all standards
- Get outside daily
- Move your body

**Long-term Solutions:**
- Therapy (specifically for postpartum rage)
- Medication if needed
- Support groups
- Lifestyle changes
- Communication strategies

### The Permission Slips You Need

You're allowed to:
- Feel angry
- Take breaks
- Ask for help
- Set boundaries
- Be imperfect
- Prioritize your needs
- Get treatment

### When Partners Don't Get It

"Just calm down" doesn't help. What does:
- "What do you need right now?"
- "I'll take the kids, you take a break"
- "Your feelings are valid"
- "How can I help prevent this build-up?"

Share this article with them.

### The Professional Perspective

As a therapist specializing in maternal mental health, here's what I know:
- Rage doesn't make you a bad mom
- It's treatable
- You won't feel this way forever
- Your kids are more resilient than you think
- Repair is possible

### When to Get Help

Seek support if:
- Rage episodes increase in frequency
- You're afraid of your reactions
- You're having thoughts of harm
- Your family is walking on eggshells
- You feel out of control

### The Hope Part

With treatment, moms report:
- "I can feel frustration without exploding"
- "I recognize my triggers now"
- "I communicate needs before I'm depleted"
- "I've forgiven myself"
- "My family feels safer"

### Moving Forward

Your rage doesn't define you. It's a symptom, not your identity. With support, you can:
- Understand your triggers
- Develop coping strategies
- Heal underlying issues
- Model emotional regulation
- Break generational patterns

### The Truth About Healing

You don't need to be rage-free to be a good mom. You need to be a human mom who:
- Acknowledges feelings
- Takes responsibility
- Seeks help when needed
- Models repair
- Keeps trying

At Bloom, we specialize in the symptoms nobody talks about. Because rage in the shadows grows. Rage in the light heals.

You're not a monster. You're a mother at the end of her rope. Let's get you some more rope.

Remember: Your rage is valid. Your healing is possible. Your family needs you whole, not perfect.

## The ADHD Mom's Guide to Not Losing Your Mind

*February 28, 2025 • 7 min read*

I was diagnosed with ADHD at 35, right after my second child was born. Suddenly, everything made sense—why adulting felt so hard, why motherhood was overwhelming, why I felt like I was always failing at something.

If you're reading this while simultaneously cooking dinner, answering texts, and trying to remember what you came into this room for... hi, friend. This one's for us.

### When ADHD Meets Motherhood

Imagine your brain is a browser with 47 tabs open. Now add:
- Sleep deprivation
- Constant interruptions
- Endless decisions
- Sensory overload
- No routine
- All the things to remember

That's ADHD motherhood. It's like playing life on expert mode with no tutorial.

### The Struggles Nobody Talks About

**Executive Function Overload**
Planning meals while scheduling appointments while remembering the field trip form while... what was I doing?

**Time Blindness + Kids**
"We need to leave in 5 minutes" means nothing to your brain OR your toddler.

**Sensory Overwhelm**
Crying baby + TV noise + cluttered house + being touched constantly = meltdown central.

**The Shame Spiral**
Everyone else seems to remember snack day. Why can't you?

**Decision Fatigue**
By 10 AM, you've made 73 decisions. Your brain is done.

### Real ADHD Mom Moments

"I put my keys in the fridge and the milk in my purse. Again." - Jessica

"I forgot picture day three times. Same kid." - Maria

"I hyperfocused on organizing the playroom for 6 hours. Kids ate cereal for all meals." - Sam

"I can plan a Disney trip but can't remember to move the laundry." - Ashley

### ADHD Mom Superpowers

Let's flip the script:
- **Crisis Management Pro** - We thrive in chaos
- **Creative Problem Solver** - Unconventional solutions are our specialty
- **Hyperfocus Hero** - When interested, we're unstoppable

### Survival Strategies That Actually Work

- Color-coding systems
- Phone reminders for everything

**Routine Anchors**

- Autopilot bedtime routine
- Sunday planning sessions

### Tech Tools for ADHD Moms

### The Medication Conversation

Let's be real about meds:

- They might not
- You deserve to explore options
- Your functioning matters

### Creating ADHD-Friendly Systems

**Command Center**
- Central calendar
- Key hooks
- Backpack zone
- Important papers spot
- Daily checklist

**Pre-Made Decisions**
- Meal rotation
- Outfit formulas
- Default activities
- Go-to responses
- Backup plans

**Launch Pads**
- Everything for tomorrow
- By the door
- Night before
- Same spot always

### When ADHD Meets Mom Guilt

"I should be able to..."
Stop. Your brain works differently. That's not failure; that's neurodiversity.

"Other moms manage..."
Other moms aren't you. Your challenges are real. Your wins count double.

"My kids deserve better..."
Your kids get creativity, empathy, flexibility, and problem-solving skills. That's pretty amazing.

### Finding Your People

ADHD moms need other ADHD moms. We need friends who:
- Don't judge the mess
- Understand time blindness
- Share strategies
- Laugh at chaos
- Remind us we're okay

### Professional Support

Consider help for:
- Diagnosis/medication
- ADHD coaching
- Therapy for shame/anxiety
- Family systems
- Parenting strategies

### The Bottom Line

ADHD motherhood is hard. Like, really hard. But it's also creative, fun, spontaneous, and full of "plot twists."

Your brain isn't broken. It's different. And different can be beautiful—messy, chaotic, overwhelming, but beautiful.

### Your ADHD Mom Mantras

- Systems over willpower
- Progress over perfection
- Grace over guilt
- Support over shame
- Different not less

At Bloom, we get ADHD moms. We understand the unique challenges and celebrate the strengths. Because motherhood is hard enough without fighting your own brain.

Remember: You're not failing at motherhood. You're doing motherhood with ADHD. That's like regular motherhood with extra credit.

And those 47 browser tabs? They're not a bug; they're a feature. A exhausting, overwhelming, sometimes brilliant feature.

You've got this, in your own beautifully chaotic way.

## Building Your Village When You Don't Have One

*March 21, 2025 • 6 min read*

"It takes a village to raise a child."

Cool. Where do I get one of those?

If you're raising kids far from family, in a new city, or just feeling isolated despite being surrounded by people—this is for you.

### The Modern Village Problem

Our grandmothers had built-in support:
- Extended family nearby
- Long-term neighbors
- Church communities
- Multi-generational wisdom

What do we have?
- Facebook groups
- Moved-away family
- Busy neighbors we've never met
- Google for advice

No wonder we're struggling.

### Why Villages Matter

It's not just about babysitting (though that's nice). Villages provide:
- Emotional support
- Practical help
- Shared wisdom
- Accountability
- Belonging
- Perspective
- Sanity breaks

Without them, parenting feels impossible because it kind of is.

### Building Your Village: The Real Way

**Start Stupidly Small**
- Wave at the same neighbor daily
- Chat at daycare pickup
- Join ONE local group
- Text that acquaintance

**Be Awkwardly Honest**
"Hi, I'm new here and desperately need mom friends. Coffee?"
Most people are relieved someone else said it first.

**Show Up Consistently**
- Same park, same time
- Every library storytime
- Weekly playgroup
- Regular coffee shop

People connect through repetition.

**Initiate Imperfectly**
Your house is messy? Invite anyway.
Can't cook? Order pizza.
Overwhelmed? Ask for help.
Perfect hosts make terrible friends.

### Village Building for Introverts

Yes, you can build a village without becoming an extrovert:

- Start with one person
- Choose quality over quantity
- Use text more than calls
- Find parallel activities (kids play while you coexist)
- Set boundaries clearly
- Take breaks between social times

### The Unexpected Village Members

Your village doesn't look like a Hallmark movie:

**The Daycare Teacher** who actually asks how YOU are
**The Neighbor** who takes your trash cans in
**The Online Friend** who gets your 2 AM anxiety
**The Pediatrician** who validates your concerns
**The Barista** who knows your order and your kids' names
**The Mom at the Park** who shares goldfish crackers

### Creating Connection Points

**Start a Thing:**
- Weekly park meetup
- Monthly mom's night
- Meal prep Sunday
- Walking group
- Book club (that's really wine club)

**Join a Thing:**
- MOPS groups
- Library programs
- Fitness classes
- Volunteer opportunities
- Local Facebook groups

**Make a Thing:**
- Neighborhood WhatsApp
- Babysitting co-op
- Toy swap
- Meal train system
- Emergency contact list

### The Vulnerability Factor

Real villages require real honesty:

"I'm drowning and need help."
"Can you watch my kid for an hour?"
"I haven't showered in three days."
"Is this normal or should I worry?"
"I'm struggling with rage."

Vulnerability invites connection. Perfection repels it.

### Digital Villages Count

Online support is real support:
- Facebook groups for your specific struggles
- Instagram communities
- Marco Polo with far away friends
- Zoom calls with family
- Reddit for 3 AM questions

Don't underestimate virtual connections.

### When Building is Hard

Some reasons village building feels impossible:
- Social anxiety
- Past rejection
- Trust issues
- Time constraints
- Language barriers
- Introversion
- Depression

These are real barriers. Work with them, not against them.

### The Reciprocity Rule

Villages work on give-and-take:
- Accept help when offered
- Offer help when able
- Share resources
- Trade services
- Be reliable
- Show appreciation

You can't only give. You can't only take. Balance builds trust.

### Red Flags in Village Building

Not everyone belongs in your village:
- Constant drama
- Boundary crossing
- Judgment/criticism
- One-sided relationships
- Toxic positivity
- Competitive parenting

Quality matters more than quantity.

### Village Maintenance

Villages need tending:
- Regular check-ins
- Shared activities
- Conflict resolution
- Boundary adjustments
- Celebration rituals
- Growth allowance

### When Professional Help is Your Village

Sometimes your village includes:
- Therapists
- Postpartum doulas
- Lactation consultants
- House cleaners
- Babysitters
- Parent coaches

Paid support is still support.

### The Long Game

Building a village takes:
- Time (months, not weeks)
- Patience (people are busy)
- Persistence (keep showing up)
- Grace (for yourself and others)
- Faith (that it will happen)

### Your Village Checklist

You need people who:
- [ ] You can text at weird hours
- [ ] Share their struggles
- [ ] Offer practical help
- [ ] Make you laugh
- [ ] Call you on your BS
- [ ] Celebrate your wins
- [ ] Show up in crisis

### The Permission Slip

You're allowed to:
- Need people
- Ask for help
- Start small
- Take breaks
- Set boundaries
- Choose your people
- Define your village

### The Truth About Villages

Modern villages don't look like traditional ones. They're:
- Pieced together
- Constantly evolving
- Imperfect
- Digital and physical
- Chosen not given
- Work to maintain

But they're possible. And necessary. And worth building.

At Bloom, we're part of many clients' villages. Because therapy is village work too—supporting, guiding, connecting.

Remember: You weren't meant to do this alone. Nobody was. Your village is out there, waiting to be built, one awkward coffee date at a time.

Start today. Wave at a neighbor. Text an acquaintance. Join one thing. Your future self will thank you.

## Navigating Life Transitions: When Everything Changes

*February 7, 2025 • 5 min read*

Last week, three different clients said the same thing: "I feel like I'm falling apart."

One just had a baby and moved cities. Another's marriage ended while she started a new career. The third became a caregiver for her parent while managing her own family.

Life transitions: They don't come one at a time.

### The Perfect Storm

Major life changes rarely happen in isolation:
- Baby arrives + relationship shifts
- Job loss + identity crisis
- Move + isolation
- Divorce + financial stress
- Loss + life restructuring

It's like the universe decides to renovate your entire life at once.

### Why Transitions Hurt

**Identity Disruption**
"Who am I if I'm not...?"
- The career woman
- The wife
- The healthy one
- The local expert
- The person I used to be

**Loss of Control**
You had plans. Life laughed. Now you're making it up as you go.

**Grief Nobody Acknowledges**
Even positive changes involve loss. But try explaining why you're sad about your promotion or new baby.

**Decision Overload**
New job? Thousand decisions.
New city? Where to shop, eat, live.
New role? Constant choices.

**Support System Disruption**
Your people might be far away, unavailable, or part of what changed.

### The Messy Middle

There's this space between "what was" and "what will be" that feels like:
- Limbo
- Chaos
- Groundlessness
- Free fall
- Lost at sea

This is normal. You're not broken. You're transitioning.

### What Actually Helps

**Accept the Mess**
Your life looks like a construction zone because it IS one. Stop expecting it to be tidy.

**Lower the Bar**
"Thriving" isn't the goal right now. Surviving is enough. Fed kids? Win. Shower today? Victory.

**Find One Anchor**
Keep ONE familiar routine. Morning coffee. Evening walk. Sunday calls home. Something.

**Name the Losses**
Write them down:
- I miss my old friends
- I miss knowing where things are
- I miss feeling competent
- I miss my old self

Acknowledging loss is the first step to moving forward.

### The Unexpected Gifts

Transitions—as brutal as they are—often bring:

**Clarity**
When everything's uncertain, what matters becomes crystal clear.

**Strength**
You discover reserves you didn't know existed.

**Freedom**
Old patterns break. New possibilities emerge.

**Connection**
Crisis reveals true friends. New helpers appear.

**Growth**
You become someone you couldn't have imagined.

### Survival Strategies

**Daily:**
- One small routine
- Movement (even 5 minutes)
- Connection (text counts)
- One accomplishment
- Early bedtime

**Weekly:**
- Therapy or support group
- Time in nature
- Social interaction
- Planning session
- Self-care activity

**Monthly:**
- Evaluate progress
- Adjust expectations
- Celebrate small wins
- Connect with constants
- Dream a little

### The Timeline Nobody Shares

Months 1-3: Total chaos. Everything feels wrong.
Months 4-6: Glimpses of new normal.
Months 7-9: Settling into patterns.
Months 10-12: "How did I get here? And it's okay."

Give yourself a full year. At least.

### When to Get Help

Seek support if you're:
- Unable to function daily
- Using substances to cope
- Isolating completely
- Having thoughts of escape
- Stuck in despair
- Physically unwell from stress

### What Not to Do

Don't:
- Make major decisions from chaos
- Compare your inside to others' outside
- Expect linear progress
- Go it completely alone
- Forget this is temporary

### The Bridge Metaphor

You're not lost. You're on a bridge. Behind you: the familiar shore. Ahead: unknown territory. The bridge feels unstable because it's suspended between worlds.

But bridges are meant to be crossed, not lived on.

### Permission Slips

You have permission to:
- Feel all the feelings
- Change your mind
- Ask for help
- Move slowly
- Grieve what was
- Not have answers
- Trust the process

### Finding Meaning

Questions that help:
- What is this transition teaching me?
- Who am I becoming?
- What patterns can I release?
- What possibilities are emerging?
- How is this serving my growth?

### The Other Side

People who've made it through report:
- "I'm more myself than ever"
- "I wouldn't go back"
- "The growth was worth the pain"
- "I trust myself now"
- "I can handle anything"

### Your Transition Toolkit

Essential supplies:
- Therapist or coach
- Journal
- Support system
- Self-compassion
- Patience
- Faith in the process
- Reminder: This too shall pass

### The Truth

Transitions are:
- Messy
- Non-linear
- Transformative
- Temporary
- Necessary
- Survivable

You're not falling apart. You're falling into place. The pieces just haven't settled yet.

At Bloom, we specialize in walking with people through life's biggest transitions. Because nobody should cross these bridges alone.

Remember: This chaos is temporary. The growth is permanent. You're becoming who you're meant to be.

And that person? They're worth the journey.
