# Creating a Multi-Avatar Video Podcast in Descript

## Current Limitations (2025)
- Descript AI avatars are designed for single-speaker videos
- You get 5-10 minutes of avatar time per month (depending on plan)
- Multiple avatars in one video isn't natively supported

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Production

### Option 1: Scene-Based Avatar Switching
1. Create separate scenes for each speaker
2. Use one avatar at a time per scene
3. Switch between scenes like a traditional podcast edit

**Setup Steps:**
1. Generate audio first (using AI voices)
2. Create Scene 1: Emma speaking (Avatar 1)
3. Create Scene 2: Madison speaking (Avatar 2)
4. Create Scene 3: Dr. Williams (Avatar 3)
5. Use Automatic Scene switching based on speaker

### Option 2: Split-Screen with Static Images
1. Use AI-generated headshots or stock photos for speakers
2. Highlight the active speaker with effects
3. Add one AI avatar for featured moments

**Layout Design:**
```
[Emma Photo] | [Madison Photo]
        [Dr. Williams]
   (Highlight active speaker)
```

### Option 3: Animated Podcast Style
1. Use animated backgrounds
2. Show speaker names/titles when they talk
3. Add one AI avatar for intro/outro only
4. Focus on audio quality with visual enhancements

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Audio First Approach
- Complete your audio podcast with AI voices
- Perfect the timing and pacing
- Export audio track

### 2. Add Visual Elements
```
Intro (0:00-0:30)
- AI Avatar introducing the show
- Title card with all speakers

Main Content (0:30-15:00)
- Speaker photos with name overlays
- Animated waveforms when speaking
- B-roll footage of relevant content
- Text overlays for key points

Outro (15:00-16:00)
- AI Avatar for closing
- Contact information
- Call to action graphics
```

### 3. Alternative: Use Other Tools
**For true multi-avatar conversations, consider:**
- **Synthesia**: Supports multiple AI avatars
- **D-ID**: Can create conversational videos
- **HeyGen**: Multi-speaker avatar videos
- Export audio from Descript â†’ Import to avatar platform

### 4. Descript-Native Solution
**Using Descript's Strengths:**
1. Record yourself once as "template speaker"
2. Use AI voice replacement for all 3 voices
3. Apply different visual filters/backgrounds per speaker
4. Use Automatic Multicam layouts

## Recommended Production Flow

### Phase 1: Audio Production
1. Import script to Descript
2. Assign AI voices to speakers
3. Generate audio
4. Edit for pacing

### Phase 2: Visual Design
1. Create title sequence
2. Design speaker introduction cards
3. Add transition graphics
4. Include relevant B-roll

### Phase 3: Avatar Integration
1. Record 1-2 minute intro with AI avatar
2. Use avatar for topic transitions
3. Create outro with avatar CTA
4. Stay within monthly avatar limits
