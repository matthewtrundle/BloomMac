# Week 1 Complete Visual Redesign Plan

## New Design Philosophy: "Gentle Strength"

### Core Principles
1. **80/20 Rule**: 80% hopeful/empowering, 20% validation
2. **Light Over Darkness**: Natural light, warm tones, openness
3. **Connection as Default**: Never show isolation without support nearby
4. **Progress Narrative**: Every struggle paired with coping/growth
5. **Professional Dignity**: No emojis, sophisticated iconography

## New Visual Mood Board

### Color Psychology Shift
- **Primary**: Soft morning light (#FFF5E6)
- **Secondary**: Gentle sage (#A8C09A)
- **Accent**: Warm coral (#F4A261)
- **Support**: Sky blue (#87CEEB)
- **Growth**: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA)

### Lighting Requirements
- Natural, soft window light
- Golden hour warmth
- No harsh shadows
- Brightness as metaphor for hope

## Redesigned Image Concepts

### Lesson 1: Welcome to Your Fourth Trimester

**Slide 1 - Hero**
```
Mother holding baby by window with soft morning light, both resting peacefully. She looks tired but content, small smile. Natural, authentic moment of quiet connection. Warm tones, hopeful atmosphere --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6
```

**Slide 2 - Real Life**
```
Friend bringing coffee to new mother, both women smiling genuinely, morning light streaming in, lived-in but cozy home, supportive moment, warm connection --ar 3:2 --style raw --v 6
```

**Slide 3 - What This Is (Grid)**
1. ```Therapist and mother in bright, plant-filled office, engaged in supportive conversation, professional but warm --ar 1:1```
2. ```Diverse group of mothers with babies in sunny community room, some laughing, genuine connection --ar 1:1```
3. ```Mother peacefully feeding baby (bottle), comfortable and confident, no judgment atmosphere --ar 1:1```

**Slide 6 - Reality Check (Reframed)**
Instead of "Hard Reality No One Talks About", title: "Your Experience Is Real"
- Mix of experiences: tired but coping, supported moments, small victories
- Every difficult image paired with coping/support image

### Lesson 2: Understanding Your Emotions

**Slide 1 - Hero**
```
Woman's face in soft light showing complex but gentle emotions - thoughtfulness, slight worry, but underlying strength. No tears, just authentic complexity --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6
```

**Emotional Spectrum - Balanced**
1. Joy: Mother laughing with baby in park
2. Overwhelm: Woman taking deep breath, hand on chest, calming herself
3. Rest: Mother peacefully resting while partner holds baby
