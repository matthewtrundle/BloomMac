## Psychoeducation Topics

### Understanding Postpartum Anxiety
**Common Manifestations:**
- Intrusive thoughts about baby's safety
- Hypervigilance and checking behaviors
- Physical symptoms (racing heart, sweating)
- Difficulty sleeping even when baby sleeps
- Catastrophic thinking about future
- Avoidance of triggering situations

### The Anxiety Paradox
**How Fighting Anxiety Increases It:**
- Resistance amplifies discomfort
- Avoidance maintains fear
- Hypervigilance exhausts resources
- Control attempts backfire
- "What we resist, persists"

### Intrusive Thoughts in New Motherhood
**Normalizing Scary Thoughts:**
- 70-100% of new mothers have intrusive thoughts
- Thoughts â‰  intentions or desires
- Evolutionary protection mechanism
- Difference between thoughts and OCD
- "Scary thoughts mean you care"

### Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Principles
1. **Psychological Flexibility** - Adapting to situations with openness
2. **Values-Driven Action** - Moving toward what matters despite discomfort
3. **Mindful Awareness** - Observing without judgment
4. **Cognitive Defusion** - Thoughts as mental events, not facts
5. **Acceptance** - Making room for difficult experiences

## Evidence-Based Coping Strategies

### 1. Mindfulness for Postpartum Anxiety
**STOP Technique:**

**"I'm Having the Thought That..."**

- Then: "I'm noticing I'm having the thought that..."
- Creates distance from thought content

**Anxiety Radio Metaphor:**
