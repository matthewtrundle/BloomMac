## Evidence-Based Coping Strategies

### 1. Gottman Method Communication Skills
**The Soft Start-Up Formula:**
1. "I feel..." (emotion)
2. "About what..." (specific situation)
3. "I need..." (positive request)

**Example:** "I feel overwhelmed about the night feedings. I need us to create a schedule where we take turns."

**Avoiding the Four Horsemen:**
- Criticism → Use "I" statements
- Contempt → Build culture of appreciation
- Defensiveness → Take responsibility
- Stonewalling → Self-soothe and return

"I understand you want to [their want]. I need [your need]. Can we find a compromise that works for both of us?"
