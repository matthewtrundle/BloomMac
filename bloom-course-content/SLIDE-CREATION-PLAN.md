### Slide Design Principles (Based on Documentation):

1. **Emotional Arc Structure**
   - Opening: Acknowledge current struggle
   - Middle: Provide understanding and tools
   - Closing: Inspire hope and action

2. **Visual Hierarchy Rules**
   - One key message per slide
   - Supporting text minimal and clear
   - Image drives emotion, text drives understanding

3. **Color Psychology Application**
   - Sage/Green: Safety and growth
   - Coral/Warm: Urgency and energy
   - Dark sections: Depth and seriousness
   - Light sections: Hope and possibility

4. **Image Placeholder System**
