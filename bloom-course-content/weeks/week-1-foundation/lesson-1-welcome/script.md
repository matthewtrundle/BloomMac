## [SLIDE 1: Cinematic Opening]
## [0:00-0:30] Opening - You Are Not Alone

**Visual:** Hero image of mother holding newborn looking forward
**Tone:** Warm, welcoming, acknowledging

"If you're here, watching this, I want you to know something important: You're already doing something right. Seeking support takes courage, especially when you're exhausted, overwhelmed, and wondering if what you're experiencing is normal.

Welcome. You belong here."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 2: You Belong Here]
## [0:30-1:30] You Belong Here

**Visual:** Diverse mothers supporting each other
**Tone:** Inclusive, validating

"My name is Dr. Jana, and over the next six weeks, I'll be your guide through what we call the fourth trimester—those first three months after birth that are unlike anything else you'll experience.

This course is your roadmap. It's based on evidence, informed by thousands of mothers' experiences, and designed for real life—not Instagram life. Whether you're in the thick of those early weeks or months past and still struggling, you're in the right place.

Here's what I promise: No judgment. No 'shoulds.' Just real support for where you are right now."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 3: What Makes This Unique]
## [1:30-3:00] The Fourth Trimester Concept

**Visual:** Four-panel grid showing brain, sleep, body, identity changes
**Tone:** Educational, normalizing

"Let's talk about what makes this time so unique. Your baby spent nine months in the perfect environment—warm, fed continuously, always held. They need a gradual transition to the outside world.

But here's what we don't talk about enough: You need a fourth trimester too.

Let me share what's actually happening to you right now—because understanding the science helps reduce the self-blame.

First, your brain. It's literally reorganizing itself. The emotional centers are hyperactive, making you more alert to your baby's needs. This can feel like anxiety, but it's actually your brain doing exactly what it should.

Sleep? Your sleep architecture has changed. You're sleeping lighter, waking easier—it's protective, but exhausting. When people say 'sleep when the baby sleeps,' they don't understand that your sleep isn't the same anymore.

Physically, you're recovering from one of the most intense experiences a body can have. Whether you birthed vaginally or by cesarean, your body has been through a marathon. Full recovery takes 12 to 18 months. Yes, months, not weeks.

And your identity? You're experiencing 'matrescence'—the psychological birth of a mother. It's as significant as adolescence, but compressed into a much shorter time."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 4: This Is NOT]
## [3:00-4:00] Setting Realistic Expectations

**Visual:** Instagram vs Reality comparison
**Tone:** Honest, liberating

"Let's get real about expectations. Social media shows us mothers who've 'bounced back' in six weeks, but here's the truth:

Recovery isn't linear. You'll have good days where you feel like yourself, followed by days where you wonder if you'll ever feel normal again. Both are part of the journey.

Bonding isn't always instant. Some mothers feel overwhelming love immediately. Others take weeks or months to develop that connection. Both are normal.

Progress looks different for everyone. Maybe it's taking a shower. Maybe it's asking for help. Maybe it's just surviving another day. All of that counts."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 5: The Timeline]
## [4:00-5:30] Your Course Journey

**Visual:** 6-week timeline overview
**Tone:** Orienting, flexible

"Over the next six weeks, here's what we'll explore together:

This week, we're building your foundation—understanding what's normal, what's not, and how to honor your experience.

Week 2, we'll focus on self-compassion and building your personal coping toolkit.

Week 3 is all about communication and building the support you need.

Week 4, we'll tackle anxiety and overwhelm with practical tools.

Week 5 explores the identity shifts of motherhood.

And Week 6 helps you create a sustainable plan for ongoing wellness.

But here's the thing: This isn't school. There's no falling behind. Go at your own pace. Skip to what you need most. Come back to lessons multiple times. This is your resource, for as long as you need it."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 6: The Emotional Reality]
## [5:30-6:30] Cultural Wisdom & The Emotional Journey

**Visual:** Mother and baby in tender moment, cultural practices
**Tone:** Educational, normalizing

"Many cultures have always understood the sacred nature of the postpartum period. In China, new mothers 'sit the month'—a protected time for healing. In Latin America, 'la cuarentena' provides 40 days of care. These aren't outdated traditions. They're wisdom we've lost in our modern rush to 'bounce back.'

Your body is healing. Your brain is rewiring. Your identity is shifting. This takes time, and that time is sacred, not selfish.

The emotional journey isn't a straight line—it's waves. Some days you'll feel capable and connected. Others, you'll wonder if you'll ever feel like yourself again. Both are part of the process."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 7: You're Not Alone]
## [6:30-7:30] Community & Statistics

**Visual:** Statistics showing 1 in 5 experience PPD, 70% hide struggles
**Tone:** Normalizing, connecting

"Here's something crucial to understand: You are not alone in this struggle.

1 in 5 mothers will experience postpartum depression or anxiety. That's 20% of us. In a room of 10 new mothers, at least 2 are struggling significantly.

But here's the heartbreaking part: 70% of mothers hide their struggles. They smile at playdates, post happy photos, and suffer in silence. 

If you're struggling, you're not weak. You're not broken. You're human, having a human response to one of life's biggest transitions."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 8: Your Path Forward]
## [7:30-9:00] When to Seek Help

**Visual:** Professional support options and resources
**Tone:** Serious but not alarming, caring

"Before we go further, let's be clear about something important. This course is educational support—it's not therapy or medical care. 

Please reach out for professional help if you're experiencing:
- Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby
- Inability to sleep even when you have the opportunity
- Persistent sadness that doesn't lift after two weeks
- Panic attacks or severe anxiety
- Feeling disconnected from reality

These aren't signs of weakness. They're signs that you need and deserve additional support. The resources section has numbers you can call anytime, including a 24/7 crisis line.

Your path forward might include therapy, medication, support groups, or a combination. There's no shame in any of it. We wouldn't expect someone to heal from surgery without proper care—why expect it of our minds?"

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 9: Today's Practice]
## [9:00-10:00] This Week's Focus

**Visual:** Woman doing daily check-in practice
**Tone:** Gentle, practical

"Your practice this week is simple but powerful: a daily check-in with yourself.

Once a day, maybe when you're feeding the baby or before bed, pause and ask:
'How am I feeling right now?'
'What do I need in this moment?'
'What's one kind thing I can do for myself?'

No judgment, just noticing. You don't have to fix anything or feel better. Just acknowledge where you are.

In your workbook, you'll find a place to track these check-ins, plus our comprehensive assessment to help you understand your starting point."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 10: Your Journey Begins Now]
## [10:00-11:00] Building Hope

**Visual:** Statistics of recovery, sunrise imagery
**Tone:** Hopeful, evidence-based

"I want to leave you with hope, backed by facts:

100% of mothers deserve support—including you.
95% of mothers recover fully with the right help.
87% report feeling significantly better by six months.

You won't feel this way forever. I know it might seem impossible right now, but healing is happening, even when you can't see it. Every day you survive is a day closer to feeling like yourself again—not your old self, but a new version who's been through something profound and emerged stronger."

---

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 11: Your Rights - Optional]
## [11:00-11:30] Empowerment Message

**Visual:** Bill of Rights for new mothers
**Tone:** Empowering, affirming

"Before we close, I want to remind you of your rights as a new mother:

You have the right to feel whatever you're feeling.
You have the right to ask for help without guilt.
You have the right to prioritize your healing.
You have the right to set boundaries.
You have the right to not enjoy every moment.
You have the right to grieve your old life while loving your new one.

Remember: You're already stronger than you know. You've brought life into this world. You're showing up for this course. You're taking steps to care for yourself.

That's not just enough—that's extraordinary."
