## [SLIDE 1: Hero Opening - Your Body's Wisdom]
## [0:00-0:30] Opening - The Spectrum of Normal

**Visual:** Woman looking concerned but hopeful
**Tone:** Direct, reassuring

"Is this normal? It's probably the question you ask yourself a dozen times a day. Is it normal to cry this much? To feel this tired? To have these thoughts? To hurt in these places?

Today, I'm going to answer those questions with clarity, so you can stop wondering and start knowing when something needs attention."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 2: Your Body Has Carried You This Far]
## [0:30-1:30] Knowledge is Power

**Visual:** Woman talking with healthcare provider
**Tone:** Empowering, educational

"Here's what I want you to understand: Questioning whether your experience is normal isn't a sign of weakness or overreacting. It's smart. It's protective. And it's exactly what you should be doing.

The challenge is that postpartum recovery has such a wide range of 'normal' that it can be hard to know when something crosses the line into concerning. Some women barely bleed; others bleed for six weeks. Some feel weepy for a few days; others ride an emotional rollercoaster for months.

So today, we're going to get specific. I'll show you what falls within the expected range of recovery and what deserves immediate attention. This knowledge is power—power to advocate for yourself, power to rest easy when things are normal, and power to act quickly when they're not."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 3: The Recovery Timeline Truth]
## [1:30-2:30] Understanding Real Recovery

**Visual:** Timeline showing realistic recovery phases
**Tone:** Matter-of-fact, validating

"Let's start with the truth about recovery timelines. Despite what society tells us, six weeks is not a magic number where everything returns to normal. 

Full recovery takes 12-18 months. Yes, months. Your organs are finding their homes again. Your hormones are recalibrating. Your brain is rewiring. This isn't slow recovery—this is normal recovery.

The fourth trimester is just the beginning. Be patient with your body. It's doing extraordinary work."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 4: What's Actually Happening Inside]
## [2:30-4:00] Normal Physical Experiences

**Visual:** Six-panel grid of normal physical symptoms
**Tone:** Matter-of-fact, normalizing

"Let's look at what's completely normal in your physical recovery:

Bleeding, called lochia. You'll bleed for up to six weeks, starting bright red, then pink, then yellowish-white. You might pass clots up to the size of a golf ball. You might bleed more when breastfeeding or when you first stand up. All normal.

Night sweats that soak your sheets. Your body is dumping the extra fluid from pregnancy, and hormone shifts make you sweat. It's uncomfortable but temporary.

Hair loss around months three to four. You didn't lose hair during pregnancy thanks to hormones. Now it's all falling out at once. You won't go bald, I promise.

Breast changes are intense. Engorgement that makes your breasts rock-hard. Leaking at random times. Size fluctuations throughout the day. Tender, cracked nipples if you're breastfeeding. Your breasts are learning a new job.

Pelvic floor changes mean you might leak urine when you sneeze, laugh, or exercise. You might feel heaviness or pressure in your vagina. Sex might be uncomfortable even after you're 'cleared.' These muscles supported 30-plus pounds and need time to recover."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 5: Common Experiences Normalized]
## [4:00-6:00] Normal Emotional Experiences

**Visual:** Woman's face showing range of emotions
**Tone:** Validating, compassionate

"Now let's talk about emotional experiences, because these can be even more confusing than physical symptoms.

The baby blues hit about 80% of new mothers, usually starting around day three when your milk comes in and hormones plummet. You might cry over nothing. Feel overwhelmed by small tasks. Swing from joy to despair in minutes. If this peaks around day five and starts improving by two weeks, it's baby blues, not depression.

Mood swings that feel extreme are normal. You might feel intense love for your baby one moment and trapped by motherhood the next. You might rage at your partner for breathing too loudly, then feel guilty for being angry. These swings are your brain trying to process massive change with disrupted sleep.

Not feeling 'in love' with your baby immediately is more common than we admit. For some, bonding is instant. For others, it grows slowly, like any relationship. Both are normal.

Intrusive thoughts—the scary 'what if' thoughts—happen to most new mothers. What if I drop the baby? What if I accidentally hurt them? These thoughts are your brain's hypervigilance, not desires. If you're horrified by the thoughts, that's actually a good sign. It means they're just thoughts, not risks."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 6: Rest as Resistance]
## [6:00-7:00] The Importance of Rest

**Visual:** Mother resting peacefully
**Tone:** Permission-giving, gentle

"Let's talk about rest. In our culture, rest feels lazy. But in postpartum recovery, rest is radical. It's necessary. It's healing.

Your body has been through a marathon. You wouldn't expect a marathon runner to be back to normal activities the next day. Why expect it of yourself?

Rest isn't just lying down. It's saying no to visitors when you're not ready. It's letting the dishes sit. It's choosing sleep over a shower sometimes. Rest is medicine."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 7: Fuel Your Recovery]
## [7:00-8:00] Nourishment Strategy

**Visual:** Nourishing foods and self-care
**Tone:** Practical, encouraging

"Nourishment goes beyond food, though food is important. You need 500 extra calories if breastfeeding, plus tons of water. But you also need:

Mental nourishment - limit news and social media if they drain you.
Emotional nourishment - surround yourself with people who support, not judge.
Spiritual nourishment - whatever connects you to something larger, whether that's nature, prayer, or music.

Feed all parts of yourself, not just your body."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 8: Movement as Medicine]
## [8:00-9:00] Gentle Movement

**Visual:** Woman doing gentle stretches
**Tone:** Encouraging, gentle

"Movement in postpartum isn't about 'bouncing back.' It's about reconnecting with your body. Start with breath. Add gentle walks. Progress to whatever feels good.

Listen to your body. Bleeding increases with too much activity—that's your body saying slow down. Honor those signals."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 9: Trust Your Instincts - When to Seek Help]
## [9:00-11:00] Physical and Emotional Warning Signs

**Visual:** Two-column layout of warning signs
**Tone:** Serious but not alarming, clear

"Now, here's when normal becomes concerning. For physical symptoms, call your provider immediately if you experience:

Heavy bleeding that soaks a pad in an hour or large clots bigger than a golf ball. Fever over 100.4. Foul-smelling discharge—lochia should smell like period blood, not rotten. Severe headaches that don't respond to medication, especially with vision changes. Chest pain, trouble breathing, or leg pain with swelling—these could signal blood clots.

For emotional health, seek help if:

Sadness, anxiety, or numbness lasts more than two weeks without improvement. You can't sleep even when you have the opportunity. You have no interest in anything—not just the baby, but food, shower, things you used to enjoy.

Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby need immediate attention. These aren't weaknesses. They're symptoms of treatable conditions. Don't wait. Don't minimize. Call."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 10: Your Body-Mind Connection]
## [11:00-11:30] Sleep Architecture Changes

**Visual:** Sleep cycle diagram
**Tone:** Educational, normalizing

"Your sleep has fundamentally changed. You're sleeping lighter, waking easier. This is protective—it helps you respond to your baby. But it's also exhausting.

This isn't permanent. Your sleep architecture will reorganize. But for now, take rest where you can get it. Ten minutes of deep rest is valuable. Don't discount it."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 11: This Week's Practice]
## [11:30-12:30] Body Gratitude Scan

**Visual:** Woman doing body scan practice
**Tone:** Gentle, practical

"This week's practice is a daily body gratitude scan. Once a day, perhaps while feeding your baby:

Start at your feet. Thank them for carrying you and extra weight for months.
Move up to your legs, your hips, your belly—thank each part for its work.
Thank your arms for holding your baby.
Thank your breasts for nourishment, whether or not you're breastfeeding.
Thank your whole body for bringing life into the world.

This isn't toxic positivity. You can be grateful AND frustrated. You can appreciate your body AND want it to heal faster. Both are true."

---

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 12: Your Recovery Rights]
## [12:30-13:30] Empowerment and Self-Advocacy

**Visual:** Empowering statements
**Tone:** Strong, affirming

"You have the right to recover at your own pace.
You have the right to ask for help without guilt.
You have the right to prioritize your healing.
You have the right to say no to anything that doesn't serve your recovery.
You have the right to trust your instincts about your body.
You have the right to seek second opinions.
You have the right to rest without earning it.

These aren't privileges. They're rights. Claim them."

## [ADVANCE TO SLIDE 13: Closing - Trust Your Body's Wisdom]
## [13:30-14:00] Closing - Knowledge Brings Peace

**Visual:** Mother looking confident and at peace
**Tone:** Reassuring, hopeful

"Now you know. You know what's normal discomfort and what needs attention. You know the words to use and who to call. You know you're not overreacting when you advocate for yourself.

Most of what you're experiencing is probably normal—difficult, but normal. And if something isn't normal? There's help. Effective help. You don't have to figure this out alone.

Trust your body. It knows how to heal. Trust your instincts. They're guiding you well. And remember—when in doubt, reach out. 

You're doing the hard work of healing. Keep going. Help is always available.

In our next lesson, we'll explore the fascinating science behind all these changes. Until then, be gentle with your recovering body. It's doing extraordinary work."
