# Week 1 Lesson 2: Script & Slide Alignment Plan

## Executive Summary
After analyzing the talk track and existing slides, I've identified key opportunities to better align the presentation with Jana's final script. The current slides cover the main topics but miss several powerful personal stories and specific examples that make the content more relatable and impactful.

## Current Slide Structure Analysis

### What's Working Well:
1. **Strong Visual Design** - Follows the Bloom design system effectively
2. **Clear Section Organization** - Physical vs. Emotional experiences are well-separated
3. **Warning Signs Coverage** - Red flags are clearly presented
4. **Professional Aesthetics** - Magazine-style layouts and color psychology

### Key Gaps to Address:

## 1. Missing Personal Stories & Examples

### Script Content Not in Slides:
- **Night Sweats Story** (Lines 23-26): Jana's vivid personal experience of soaking through nightgown and sheets
- **Baby Blues Personal Story** (Lines 47-52): Kitchen crying moment with her mom
- **Emotional Detail** (Lines 82-86): The balcony intrusive thought example needs more nuance
- **Provider Advocacy Script** (Lines 117-121): Specific words to use when dismissed

### Recommendation:
Add 2-3 new slides featuring these personal moments with appropriate imagery and quote-style text overlays.

## 2. Timeline & Duration Details

### Missing from Current Slides:
- Baby blues timeline: "starts around day 3, peaks around day 5, improves by 2 weeks"
- Hair loss timing: "starts around months 3-4"
- 6-week bleeding duration is mentioned but not the color progression detail

### Recommendation:
Create a visual timeline slide showing the progression of normal symptoms over the first 6 months.

## 3. Intrusive Thoughts Nuance

### Current Coverage:
Slide 4 mentions intrusive thoughts briefly in a symptom card

### Script Emphasis:
- Extensive discussion (Lines 59-65 and 82-95)
- Important distinction between thoughts vs. desires
- "If you're horrified by these thoughts, that's actually a good sign"
- Specific example of balcony thought

### Recommendation:
Dedicate a full slide to intrusive thoughts with careful, compassionate messaging and visual metaphors for protection/safety.

## 4. Provider Communication

### Missing Elements:
- Postpartum Support International phone number: 1-800-944-4773
- PSI Provider directory mention
- Jana's credential mention (Lines 106-108)
- Writing down symptoms before appointment (Lines 111-114)
- Bringing support person to appointments

### Recommendation:
Expand the "How to Get Help" section to include these practical details.

## 5. Specific Word-for-Word Advice

### Script Highlights Not in Slides:
- "I'm struggling more than I think is normal" - this is in slides âœ“
- "I need you to take this seriously. This doesn't feel normal for me."
- "I don't feel like myself and I need to be evaluated for postpartum mood disorders."

### Recommendation:
Add these specific phrases to empower self-advocacy.

## Proposed New/Modified Slides

### Slide 3.5: "My Own Story" (New)
- Split layout with warm, relatable image
- Quote overlay with night sweats story
- Normalizes the experience through personal connection

### Slide 4.5: "Understanding Intrusive Thoughts" (New)
- Dark theme with protective imagery
- Clear distinction between thoughts and intentions
- Reassuring message about being horrified = good sign

### Slide 5.5: "Timeline of Normal" (New)
- Visual timeline showing 0-6 months postpartum
- Color-coded symptoms appearing/resolving
- Helps set expectations

### Slide 7.5: "Your Advocacy Toolkit" (Enhanced)
- Expand current help slide
- Add PSI details and credential information
- Include symptom tracking reminder
- Support person recommendation

### Slide 8.5: "When Providers Dismiss You" (New)
- Empowering imagery
- Specific scripts for pushing back
- Validates the experience of being dismissed

## Visual Recommendations

### Image Needs:
1. Woman experiencing night sweats (authentic, not glamorized)
2. Mother having emotional moment in kitchen/home setting
3. Woman writing in journal/phone for symptom tracking
4. Two women at medical appointment (support person)
5. Woman looking confident/empowered despite struggle

### Color Psychology Updates:
- Use more coral/red for urgency in warning sections
- Add golden/warm tones for personal story sections
- Maintain mint/sage for reassurance and normal experiences

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority:
1. Add intrusive thoughts dedicated slide
2. Enhance provider communication/advocacy section
3. Include timeline visualization

### Medium Priority:
1. Add personal story slides
2. Expand symptom tracking tools section

### Lower Priority:
1. Fine-tune existing slide text to match script language
2. Add fragment animations for progressive disclosure

## Next Steps
1. Create mockups of proposed new slides
2. Source appropriate images following Bloom guidelines
3. Write refined copy that captures Jana's voice
4. Review with Jana for authenticity
5. Implement changes maintaining design system standards

## Success Metrics
- Every major story/example from script has visual representation
- Mothers feel equipped with specific words and tools
- Balance of validation, normalization, and empowerment
- Personal connection through Jana's stories
- Clear action steps throughout

This alignment will transform the presentation from informative to truly connective, matching the warmth and specificity of Jana's script while maintaining the professional design standards.
