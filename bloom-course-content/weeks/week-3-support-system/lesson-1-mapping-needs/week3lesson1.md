# Week 3, Lesson 1: Mapping Your Support Needs & Resources
*Video Script - 12 minutes*

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Welcome back to Week 3. I'm Dr. Jana Rundle, and this week we're focusing on something that might feel vulnerable but is absolutely essential: building your support ecosystem.

If asking for help feels hard, if you've always been the one others lean on, if you're worried about being a burden - this week is especially for you. We're going to transform how you think about support.

## The Myth of Independent Motherhood (2 minutes)

Let's start with a truth that our culture doesn't often acknowledge: Humans were never meant to raise children alone.

Throughout history, across every culture, new mothers have been surrounded by support. The phrase "it takes a village" isn't just a nice saying - it's biological reality. Your nervous system is literally designed to co-regulate with others during times of stress.

Yet here we are, in a culture that celebrates independence, trying to do something that was always meant to be communal. No wonder it feels so hard.

Research by Dr. Sarah Blaffer Hrdy shows that throughout human evolution, mothers who had strong support networks had babies who thrived. Your need for help isn't weakness - it's wisdom encoded in your DNA.

When you resist asking for help, you're not being strong. You're fighting against millions of years of evolution. And that fight is exhausting you.

## Understanding Your Support Needs (2.5 minutes)

Support isn't one-size-fits-all. Let's map out the different types of support you might need:

**Practical Support**:
- Someone to hold the baby while you shower
- Help with laundry, meals, or groceries
- Rides to appointments
- Someone to watch older children

**Emotional Support**:
- A listening ear without judgment
- Validation of your experience
- Someone who's been through it
- Permission to feel all your feelings

**Informational Support**:
- Answers to baby care questions
- Resources for common challenges
- Recommendations for services
- Guidance through decisions

**Social Support**:
- Adult conversation
- Feeling connected to the world
- Maintaining your identity
- Shared experiences with peers

Right now, pause and ask yourself: Which type of support do I need most? Which am I getting least?

Most mothers find they're drowning in informational support (everyone has advice!) but starving for practical and emotional support. Sound familiar?

## Identifying Your Current Resources (2 minutes)

Before we can build your support system, let's see what's already there. Sometimes support exists but we can't see it through our exhaustion or shame.

Think about:
- **Family**: Who's truly available and willing? (Not just who "should" help)
- **Friends**: Who checks in? Who would come if you called?
- **Community**: Neighbors, faith communities, local groups
- **Professional**: Healthcare providers, therapists, doulas
- **Online**: Virtual communities, support groups, resources

Now the harder question: What prevents you from accessing these resources?

Common barriers include:
- "I don't want to bother anyone"
- "They have their own problems"
- "I should be able to handle this"
- "What if they judge me?"
- "I've never needed help before"

These aren't truths - they're cultural programming that's keeping you isolated.

## The Cultural Barriers to Asking for Help (2 minutes)

Let's name what we're up against. Our culture has specific messages that make asking for help feel impossible:

**The Supermom Myth**: The idea that good mothers do it all, with a smile, while looking perfect. This myth sells products but destroys mothers.

**The Independence Trap**: We're taught that needing others is weakness. But interdependence - not independence - is the marker of emotional maturity.

**The Burden Belief**: "I don't want to be a burden." But here's the truth: You're not a burden. You're a human being in one of life's most demanding transitions.

**The Reciprocity Worry**: "I can't pay them back right now." Support doesn't always need to be reciprocal immediately. Sometimes you receive now and give back years later.

Dr. Bren√© Brown's research shows that asking for help is actually a sign of strength. It requires vulnerability, and vulnerability is the birthplace of connection, creativity, and change.

## Overcoming Shame Around Needing Support (1.5 minutes)

Shame thrives in silence and secrecy. Let's bring it into the light.

If you feel shame about needing help, you're not alone. A study of 1,000 new mothers found that 89% felt guilty asking for support, even when desperately needed.

But consider this: When a friend asks you for help, how do you feel? Honored? Trusted? Useful? That's how others feel when you ask them.

By not asking for help, you're actually denying others the opportunity to show up for you. You're robbing them of the joy of being useful, of mattering, of contributing to your village.

Reframe it: Asking for help isn't taking. It's giving others the gift of being able to give.

## Creating Your Support Map (2 minutes)

Let's make this practical. You're going to create a support map - a visual representation of your resources.

Draw yourself in the center. Around you, create circles for:
- Inner circle: People you can call at 3 AM
- Middle circle: People you can ask for regular help
- Outer circle: People you can reach out to occasionally

For each person, note:
- What kind of support they're best at
- What you'd feel comfortable asking them for
- Any barriers to reaching out

Include potential resources too - that mom from prenatal class, the neighbor who offered help, the postpartum doula you've been considering.

This isn't just an exercise. Research shows that simply knowing support is available - even if you don't use it - reduces stress hormones and improves wellbeing.

## Making the Ask - Scripts and Strategies (2 minutes)

The hardest part is often knowing how to ask. Here are scripts that work:

**For practical help**:
"I'm struggling with [specific thing]. Would you be willing to [specific request] on [specific day/time]?"

Example: "I'm struggling to keep up with laundry. Would you be willing to come fold clothes with me Thursday afternoon while we chat?"

**For emotional support**:
"I'm having a hard time and could use someone to listen. No advice needed, just a caring ear. Do you have 20 minutes to talk?"

**For informational support**:
"You mentioned you dealt with [specific issue]. Could I ask you a few questions about what worked for you?"

**Keys to effective asking**:
- Be specific (not "I need help" but "I need someone to hold the baby for 30 minutes")
- Give options ("Tuesday or Thursday?")
- Make it easy to say yes
- Express gratitude, not apology

## Closing (30 seconds)

Your assignment this week: Complete your support map and make ONE ask for help. Start small. Maybe it's asking someone to bring you coffee. Maybe it's accepting an offer you previously declined.

Remember: You're not meant to do this alone. Your baby needs a village, and so do you. Building that village isn't weakness - it's one of the most important things you can do for your family.

Next lesson, we'll focus on strengthening your partnership during this transition. Until then, be brave enough to need others. Your vulnerability is your strength.
