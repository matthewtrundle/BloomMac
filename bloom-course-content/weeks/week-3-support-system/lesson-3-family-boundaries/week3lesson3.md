# Week 3, Lesson 3: Setting Boundaries with Extended Family
*Video Script - 11 minutes*

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Today we're talking about something that can feel impossible: setting boundaries with the people who raised you, who love your baby, who "just want to help."

If you're caught between gratitude and frustration, between needing support and needing space, between your family's expectations and your instincts - welcome to one of postpartum's trickiest dances.

## Why Family Boundaries Are So Hard (2 minutes)

Setting boundaries with family hits different than with friends or strangers. Here's why:

**The Guilt Factor**: "They're just trying to help." "They love the baby." "They did so much for me." Guilt becomes a boundary-killer.

**Cultural Expectations**: Many cultures emphasize family harmony over individual needs. Setting boundaries can feel like betrayal of cultural values.

**Role Reversal**: You're still their child, but now you're the parent. This identity shift is disorienting for everyone.

**The FOG**: Fear, Obligation, and Guilt - the toxic trio that keeps unhealthy patterns alive. Family systems expert Susan Forward coined this term because these emotions create a fog that obscures clear thinking.

**Generational Differences**: "We didn't have all these rules when you were a baby and you turned out fine!" Sound familiar?

Here's the truth: Boundaries aren't walls. They're bridges to healthier relationships. When you set clear boundaries, you're actually preserving the relationship rather than damaging it.

## Common Boundary Violations (2 minutes)

Let's name what's actually happening:

**The Overtaker**: Swoops in and takes baby without asking, reorganizes your home, makes decisions without consulting you.

**The Critic**: "The baby seems cold." "Are you sure they're getting enough to eat?" "In my day, we didn't..."

**The Boundary Pusher**: Shows up unannounced, stays too long, ignores your rules about kissing baby or posting photos.

**The Guilt Tripper**: "I guess I'll just never see my grandchild." "Other grandparents get to..." "After all I've done..."

**The Know-It-All**: Dismisses your parenting choices, undermines your decisions, treats you like you know nothing.

**The Helper Who Doesn't**: Comes to "help" but creates more work - needs entertaining, makes messes, holds baby while you clean.

If you're nodding along, feeling a mix of recognition and anger - that's normal. The anger is information. It's telling you where boundaries are needed.

## Cultural Considerations (1.5 minutes)

Boundaries look different across cultures, and that's okay. Your work is to find what honors both your cultural values AND your needs as a new parent.

**In Collectivist Cultures**: Frame boundaries as protecting family harmony. "When I'm rested, I'm a better mother, which honors our family."

**With Traditional Gender Roles**: "I'm grateful for your wisdom. I'm also learning what works for our specific baby."

**Navigating "Respect Your Elders"**: Respect doesn't mean obedience. You can honor their experience while trusting your instincts.

**Managing Multiple Cultures**: If you and your partner come from different cultural backgrounds, create new family traditions that blend both while serving your nuclear family's needs.

Dr. Monica McGoldrick's research on family systems shows that healthy boundaries can actually strengthen cultural bonds by preventing resentment and burnout.

## The Boundary Setting Formula (2 minutes)

Here's a framework that works:

**Step 1: Appreciation**
Start with genuine gratitude. "I'm so grateful you want to be involved..."

**Step 2: Specific Boundary**
Clear and concrete. "I need everyone to text before visiting..."

**Step 3: Reason (Optional)**
Only if it helps. "This helps me manage the baby's schedule..."

**Step 4: Alternative/Compromise**
Show flexibility. "How about we set up regular Sunday visits?"

**Example Scripts**:

For unexpected visits:
"Mom, I love that you want to see the baby. I need you to text before coming over so I can let you know if it's a good time. How about we plan your visits in advance so we can really enjoy them?"

For unsolicited advice:
"I appreciate your experience. Right now, I'm following our pediatrician's guidance on this. I'll definitely ask if I need suggestions."

For social media boundaries:
"We're not sharing baby photos online yet. We'd love to text you photos directly that you can enjoy privately."

## Handling Pushback (2 minutes)

Expect resistance. It's not a sign you're doing something wrong - it's a sign the boundary is needed.

**Common Responses and How to Handle Them**:

"You're being too sensitive"
- "I might be sensitive right now, and that's okay. I still need this boundary."

"We're just trying to help"
- "I know, and I'm grateful. This is how you can help most right now."

"We did things differently and you survived"
- "I'm glad I did! And now I'm making the choices that feel right for my family."

"You're keeping us from our grandchild"
- "I want you to have a wonderful relationship with baby. These boundaries help make visits positive for everyone."

**The Broken Record Technique**: Repeat your boundary calmly without justifying, arguing, defending, or explaining more. "I understand you disagree. I still need visitors to text first."

## Creating Sustainable Family Relationships (1.5 minutes)

Boundaries aren't just about saying no. They're about creating sustainable relationships:

**Define Helpful Help**: Be specific about what actually helps. "It would be amazing if you could bring dinner and eat with us" vs. vague "come help."

**Create Roles**: Give family members specific ways to contribute. Grandpa is the evening walk person. Grandma reads stories. Everyone has value.

**Schedule Connection**: Regular, planned visits reduce anxiety for everyone. "Wednesdays are Grandma days" sets expectations.

**Communicate Through Your Partner**: If it's their family causing stress, they need to be the primary boundary setter. Present a united front.

**Model What You Want**: Show them how to interact with baby. "Watch how I soothe her when she's fussy" teaches without lecturing.

## Protecting Your Peace (1 minute)

Remember:
- You can be grateful AND have boundaries
- Their disappointment is not your emergency
- Your baby needs a calm parent more than appeased grandparents
- Setting boundaries now prevents bigger conflicts later
- You're teaching your child that their needs matter

When guilt rises, ask yourself: "What would I want my child to do in this situation when they're a parent?" Then do that.

## Closing (30 seconds)

This week, identify ONE boundary that needs setting with family. Start small. Use the formula. Expect pushback. Stand firm with love.

Your family relationships will evolve as you do. Boundaries aren't permanent walls - they're temporary structures that can shift as needed. But they're essential for protecting your energy and sanity right now.

Next lesson, we explore building your village beyond family. Until then, remember: Good boundaries make good grandparents.
