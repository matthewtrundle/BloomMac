# Week 4, Lesson 2: Calming Your Nervous System
*Video Script - 9 minutes*

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Welcome back. Today we're learning how to speak directly to your nervous system in a language it understands - not through thoughts or logic, but through your body.

If you've tried to "think" your way out of anxiety and failed, that's because anxiety lives in your body, not just your mind. Today, you'll learn rapid-relief techniques based on polyvagal theory that can shift your state in seconds to minutes.

## Understanding Your Nervous System (1.5 minutes)

Let me introduce you to your vagus nerve - the superhighway of your nervous system. It's the longest nerve in your body, connecting your brain to your heart, lungs, and gut.

Dr. Stephen Porges' polyvagal theory shows us that our nervous system has three states:

**Ventral Vagal** (Safe and Social):
- Calm, connected, capable
- Can think clearly and problem-solve
- This is where we want to be

**Sympathetic** (Fight or Flight):
- Heart racing, muscles tense
- Ready for action but can't think clearly
- Where anxiety lives

**Dorsal Vagal** (Freeze or Shutdown):
- Numb, disconnected, collapsed
- When overwhelm becomes too much
- Depression often lives here

As a new mother, you're likely bouncing between sympathetic (anxiety) and dorsal (exhaustion), rarely landing in ventral (calm). But here's the good news: You can directly influence which state you're in.

## The Power of the Breath (2 minutes)

Your breath is the remote control for your nervous system. It's the only automatic function you can consciously control, making it your direct line to calm.

**The 4-7-8 Breath** (Dr. Andrew Weil):
- Inhale through nose for 4 counts
- Hold for 7 counts
- Exhale through mouth for 8 counts
- Repeat 3-4 times

Why it works: The extended exhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system, literally telling your body "we're safe."

**The Physiological Sigh** (Dr. Andrew Huberman):
- Take a normal inhale through your nose
- Add a second, smaller inhale on top
- Long, slow exhale through your mouth
- Repeat 2-3 times

This double-inhale maximally expands your lungs and is the fastest way to calm your system - it's what your body does naturally when you've been crying.

**Box Breathing** (Used by Navy SEALs):
- Inhale for 4
- Hold for 4
- Exhale for 4
- Hold empty for 4

This creates rhythm and predictability, which your nervous system loves.

Practice these when calm so they're automatic when anxious.

## Vagus Nerve Activation Techniques (2 minutes)

Beyond breath, we can directly stimulate the vagus nerve:

**Cold Water Therapy**:
- Splash cold water on your face
- Hold ice cubes on your temples
- Take a cold shower (even 30 seconds)
Cold activates the dive response, immediately slowing heart rate.

**Humming and Singing**:
- Hum your favorite lullaby
- Sing to your baby (badly is fine!)
- Even gargling works
The vibrations stimulate the vagus nerve where it passes through your throat.

**Gentle Neck Stretches**:
- Slowly turn head right, hold 30 seconds
- Return to center, turn left
- Gentle head rolls
The vagus nerve runs through your neck - stretching helps release tension.

**The Basic Exercise** (Stanley Rosenberg):
- Lie on your back
- Interlace fingers behind head
- Look right with eyes only (not head) for 30 seconds
- Return to center, look left for 30 seconds
This resets the nervous system through eye movements.

**Loving Touch**:
- Hand on heart with gentle pressure
- Self-hug with gentle squeezing
- Butterfly hug (arms crossed, tapping shoulders)
Touch releases oxytocin, your body's natural anti-anxiety hormone.

## Movement for Anxiety Release (1.5 minutes)

Anxiety is energy that needs somewhere to go. Instead of letting it spiral in your mind, discharge it through movement:

**Shaking Practice**:
- Stand and shake your whole body vigorously for 30 seconds
- Let everything jiggle - be ridiculous
- Stop and stand still, noticing the calm
Animals do this naturally after stress. It literally discharges anxiety from your system.

**Wall Push-Ups**:
- Place hands on wall
- Push hard for 10 seconds
- Release and breathe
- Repeat 3 times
This gives your fight-or-flight energy something to do.

**Legs Up the Wall**:
- Lie on floor, scoot close to wall
- Rest legs up wall for 5-10 minutes
- Arms out to sides, palms up
This posture tells your nervous system "no running needed here."

**Dance It Out**:
- Put on one song
- Move however feels good
- Include baby if awake
Movement with music is double nervous system medicine.

## Creating Your Calm Kit (1.5 minutes)

Build a physical kit for anxiety moments:

**Sensory Items**:
- Lavender roller or essential oil
- Soft fabric or baby's blanket
- Stress ball or putty
- Mints or sour candy (taste grounds you)

**Temperature Tools**:
- Ice pack for face/neck
- Heating pad for shoulders
- Cold water bottle

**Audio Support**:
- Calming playlist ready to go
- Guided meditation app
- White noise or nature sounds

**Visual Anchors**:
- Photos that bring joy
- Calming images (beach, forest)
- Written affirmations

Keep versions everywhere - diaper bag, car, bedside, kitchen. When anxiety hits, you need tools within reach.

## The 3-3-3 Practice (1 minute)

When you need immediate grounding:

**See 3 Things**: Name three things you can see right now
**Hear 3 Things**: Identify three sounds in your environment  
**Move 3 Parts**: Move three parts of your body

This brings you instantly into the present moment, interrupting the anxiety spiral. It works because anxiety lives in future "what-ifs," not in the present moment.

You can do this while nursing, in line at the store, during a night feeding - anywhere, anytime.

## Closing (30 seconds)

Your practice this week: Choose TWO techniques from today's lesson. Practice them when calm. Use them when anxious. Notice what shifts.

Remember: Calming your nervous system isn't about never feeling anxious. It's about having tools to return to calm. Your body knows how to be peaceful - sometimes it just needs reminders.

Next lesson, we'll work with racing thoughts. For now, breathe. Your nervous system is listening.
