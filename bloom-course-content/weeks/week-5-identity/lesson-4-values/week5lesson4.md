# Week 5, Lesson 4: Reconnecting with Your Core Values
*Video Script - 13 minutes*

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Today we complete our identity exploration by connecting to your deepest guide: your values. 

If you've felt lost in the sea of parenting advice, conflicting opinions, and "shoulds" - your values are your North Star. They'll guide every decision, resolve every conflict, and remind you who you are when the fog of exhaustion clouds everything else.

## Understanding Values vs. Rules (2 minutes)

First, let's clarify what values are and aren't:

**Values ARE**:
- Core beliefs about what matters most
- Flexible guides that adapt to context
- Internally chosen, not externally imposed
- Life directions, not destinations
- Always accessible, even in difficult moments

**Values ARE NOT**:
- Rigid rules that create guilt
- Goals you achieve and check off
- What others think you should care about
- Perfectionist standards
- Fixed or unchangeable

Dr. Steven Hayes, founder of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, describes values as "chosen life directions." You never arrive at "compassion" or "authenticity" - you practice moving toward them daily.

For mothers, values become especially crucial. When you're sleep-deprived and overwhelmed, when advice conflicts and nothing feels certain, your values whisper: "This way. This is who you are."

## Identifying Your Core Values (3 minutes)

Let's discover what truly matters to you:

**The Peak Moment Exercise**:
Think of a moment in your life when you felt most alive, most yourself. What values were you living in that moment?
- Adventure? Connection? Creativity?
- Learning? Service? Freedom?
- Beauty? Justice? Play?

**The Role Model Reflection**:
Who do you admire? What about them inspires you? Their lived values often reflect your own aspirations.

**The Anger Indicator**:
What makes you furious? Anger often signals violated values. If injustice enrages you, justice is likely a core value.

**Common Maternal Values** (not exhaustive):
- Connection: Deep relationships matter most
- Growth: Always learning and evolving
- Authenticity: Being real over being perfect
- Compassion: Kindness toward self and others
- Presence: Fully experiencing life
- Creativity: Expressing and making
- Security: Providing safety and stability
- Adventure: Exploring and experiencing
- Service: Contributing beyond yourself
- Wisdom: Understanding deeply

From these, identify your top 3-5. These become your council of advisors.

## How Motherhood Challenges Values (2 minutes)

Here's where it gets complex: Motherhood can feel like it conflicts with your values.

**If you value Freedom**: Baby's needs feel like prison bars
**If you value Achievement**: Daily tasks feel meaningless
**If you value Order**: Chaos reigns supreme
**If you value Independence**: Constant dependence suffocates
**If you value Creativity**: No energy for expression

This creates values conflict - feeling torn between who you were and who you need to be.

But here's the shift: Your values don't change. How you express them does.

- Freedom becomes choosing your response to baby's needs
- Achievement becomes raising a human being
- Order becomes finding peace within chaos
- Independence becomes modeling self-sufficiency
- Creativity becomes innovative problem-solving

Dr. Kelly Wilson calls this "values flexibility" - same core values, evolved expression.

## Living Your Values as a Mother (2.5 minutes)

Let's make this practical:

**Value: Connection**
- Old expression: Long dinners with friends
- New expression: Texting hearts to friends while nursing

**Value: Learning**
- Old expression: Graduate courses
- New expression: Learning baby's cues, child development

**Value: Adventure**
- Old expression: International travel
- New expression: Exploring neighborhoods with stroller

**Value: Creativity**
- Old expression: Evening art classes
- New expression: Making up silly songs for baby

**Value: Health**
- Old expression: Gym sessions
- New expression: Walking with baby, dancing in kitchen

The key is asking: "How can I honor this value within my current constraints?"

**Daily Values Check-In**:
Each morning ask: "Which value wants attention today?"
Each evening ask: "How did I honor my values today?"

Small, consistent actions aligned with values create deep satisfaction.

## Values-Based Decision Making (2 minutes)

Values simplify difficult decisions:

**The Values Filter**:
When facing a decision, ask:
1. Which option aligns with my core values?
2. Which would I choose if no one was watching?
3. Which would I want my child to see me choose?
4. Which serves my family's collective values?

**Example Scenarios**:

*Sleep Training Decision*:
- Value: Compassion → "What approach feels most compassionate to all?"
- Value: Independence → "What teaches healthy self-soothing?"
- Value: Connection → "What maintains our bond?"

*Work/Stay Home Decision*:
- Value: Service → "How can I best serve my family and community?"
- Value: Growth → "What allows continued development?"
- Value: Security → "What provides needed stability?"

No universal right answer. Your values create YOUR right answer.

## Creating a Family Values Statement (1.5 minutes)

As you clarify personal values, consider family values:

**Questions for Partners**:
- What kind of family do we want to be?
- What do we want our child to learn from us?
- What matters more than being comfortable?
- How do we want to be remembered?

**Sample Family Values Statements**:
- "We choose connection over perfection"
- "We practice brave vulnerability"
- "We find joy in small moments"
- "We grow through challenges together"
- "We lead with love, not fear"

Write yours down. Post it where you'll see it. Reference it during conflicts.

## When Values Feel Impossible (1 minute)

Some days, survival mode reigns. Values feel like luxury.

On these days:
- **Micro-alignments count**: One kind word (compassion), one deep breath (presence)
- **Intention matters**: Wanting to live values counts when energy fails
- **Tomorrow exists**: Not honoring values today doesn't mean abandoning them
- **Self-compassion IS a value**: Being kind to yourself when you fall short

Dr. Kristin Neff reminds us: "You can't always control whether you live your values. You can always return to them."

## Closing (30 seconds)

This week, identify your top 3 values. Write them where you'll see them daily. Notice opportunities to honor them, however small.

Your values are your essence - unchanged by sleepless nights or spit-up stains. They're the through-line connecting who you were, who you are, and who you're becoming.

Next week, we integrate everything into sustainable wellness. Until then, let your values guide you home to yourself.
