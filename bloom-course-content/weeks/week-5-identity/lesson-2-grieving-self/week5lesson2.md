# Week 5, Lesson 2: Grieving Who You Were
*Video Script - 11 minutes*

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Today we're addressing something rarely discussed but universally experienced: the grief of losing your pre-baby self. 

If you've felt guilty for missing your old life, if you've cried for freedoms lost, if you've wondered whether admitting this grief makes you a bad mother - this lesson is permission to feel it all.

## The Unnamed Loss (2 minutes)

We have rituals for death, divorce, job loss. But the loss of self that comes with motherhood? We're expected to feel only joy.

This is called disenfranchised grief - a loss that society doesn't acknowledge or validate. Yet what you've lost is real:

- Your autonomous self who could make decisions without considering another life
- Your body as you knew it
- Your relationship dynamic as a couple
- Your career identity or momentum
- Your freedom to be spontaneous
- Your ability to meet your own needs first
- Your sense of competence and control
- Sleep, privacy, independence

Dr. Pauline Boss calls this "ambiguous loss" - the person you were is gone, but there's no funeral, no acknowledgment, no space to mourn.

Meanwhile, everyone celebrates your gain, making you feel monstrous for noticing what's gone. But here's the truth: You can be grateful for your baby AND grieve your losses. Both are real. Both deserve space.

## Understanding Identity Grief (2 minutes)

Grief isn't just about death. It's about any significant loss, and losing your pre-baby identity qualifies.

The stages aren't linear, but you might recognize:

**Denial**: "I'll be back to myself soon." "Nothing has to change." "I can do it all."

**Anger**: Rage at partner's unchanged life. Fury at friends who don't get it. Resentment at baby's needs.

**Bargaining**: "If I just try harder..." "Maybe if I sleep train..." "Once baby is older..."

**Depression**: The weight of loss settles. Energy drains. Joy feels impossible.

**Acceptance**: Not "being okay" with loss, but acknowledging its reality and learning to carry it.

You might cycle through all stages in one day. You might skip some, repeat others. Your grief is as unique as your loss.

Dr. Kenneth Doka's research on disenfranchised grief shows that unnamed losses often hurt more because we grieve alone, without support or validation.

## What We're Actually Grieving (2.5 minutes)

Let's name the specific losses:

**The Competent Self**: You excelled at your job, managed your life, felt capable. Now you can't figure out why baby cries or remember if you ate lunch.

**The Physical Self**: Your body did incredible things, but it's unrecognizable. Clothes don't fit. Energy is gone. Sexuality feels foreign.

**The Intellectual Self**: You had interesting thoughts, read books, engaged with ideas. Now your brain feels like mush, conversations revolve around bodily functions.

**The Social Self**: Friendships were easy. Now scheduling is impossible, energy for connection depleted, topics of conversation limited.

**The Spontaneous Self**: You could decide to go out, travel, sleep in. Now every decision requires logistics rivaling a military operation.

**The Professional Self**: Whether you've paused career or juggle both, your professional identity is altered. Ambition might feel different. Priorities have shifted.

**The Couple Self**: You were partners, lovers, friends. Now you're co-parents first, everything else when possible.

Each loss is real. Each deserves acknowledgment.

## The Complexity of Grieving While Loving (1.5 minutes)

The hardest part? You're grieving because of someone you deeply love.

This creates complicated feelings:
- Guilt: "How can I mourn when I wanted this baby?"
- Shame: "Good mothers don't feel this way"
- Confusion: "I love my baby but hate my life"
- Fear: "What if I never feel like myself again?"
- Isolation: "I can't tell anyone I feel this way"

Therapist Molly Millwood describes this as "mourning at the birthday party" - everyone's celebrating while you're grieving, making you feel crazy for your sadness.

But consider: Your grief is evidence of how fully you lived your pre-baby life. You're mourning because something meaningful was lost. That's not pathology - that's love.

## Healthy Grief Practices (2 minutes)

Grief needs expression to move through you:

**Write a Goodbye Letter**: 
To your pre-baby self. Thank her. Honor what she accomplished. Let her know she's not forgotten.

**Create a Memory Box**:
Photos, tickets, objects from your old life. Not to live in the past, but to honor it existed.

**Ritual Release**:
- Light a candle for each loss
- Write losses on paper, burn or bury them
- Create art representing transformation
- Have a "funeral" for your old life with trusted friend

**Daily Grief Minutes**:
Set timer for 5 minutes. Feel the losses fully. When timer ends, return to present. Contained grief is manageable grief.

**Movement Release**:
Grief lives in the body. Dance to sad songs. Punch pillows. Walk with intention to move grief through you.

**Share Your Story**:
Find one safe person. Say: "I need to talk about what I've lost." Speaking grief aloud reduces its power.

## Integration: Both/And Thinking (1.5 minutes)

The goal isn't to "get over" grief but to integrate it:

**Instead of Either/Or**:
- Either I'm grateful OR I'm grieving
- Either I love motherhood OR I miss my old life
- Either I'm a good mom OR I have regrets

**Embrace Both/And**:
- I'm grateful AND I'm grieving
- I love motherhood AND I miss my old life  
- I'm a good mom AND I have regrets

This isn't contradiction - it's wholeness. You're large enough to hold multiple truths.

Dr. Bren√© Brown's research shows that people who can hold paradox - joy and sorrow, gratitude and grief - have greater resilience and life satisfaction.

## Finding Meaning in Loss (1 minute)

Grief transforms when we find meaning:

- What strengths emerged from your losses?
- How has loss deepened your compassion?
- What clarity came from letting go?
- How might your grief help another mother?

Your losses aren't meaningless. They're the cocoon from which your new self emerges. The butterfly remembers being a caterpillar - that memory informs her flight.

## Closing (30 seconds)

This week, honor one specific loss. Write about it, create ritual around it, share it with someone safe. Give your grief the dignity it deserves.

Remember: Grieving your old self doesn't mean you don't love your new life. It means you're brave enough to acknowledge the full cost of transformation.

Next lesson, we explore integrating all parts of you. Until then, let yourself mourn what was, even as you nurture what is.
