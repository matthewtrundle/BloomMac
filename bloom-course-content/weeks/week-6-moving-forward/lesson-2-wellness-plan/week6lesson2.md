# Week 6, Lesson 2: Building Your Long-Term Wellness Plan
*Video Script - 11 minutes*

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Today we're creating something essential: your personalized, sustainable wellness plan. Not a rigid program you'll abandon in a week, but a flexible framework that grows with you and your baby.

This isn't about perfection or dramatic life overhauls. It's about weaving wellness into your real life in ways that actually work.

## The Evolution of Needs (2 minutes)

First, let's acknowledge that your wellness needs will evolve:

**0-3 Months**: Survival mode. Wellness means sleep, food, basic hygiene, emotional support.

**3-6 Months**: Emerging routine. Can add gentle movement, brief self-care moments, social connection.

**6-12 Months**: More predictability. Space for identity work, relationship attention, creative expression.

**12+ Months**: New challenges (mobility, tantrums) but more capacity. Deeper wellness practices possible.

Dr. Diana Sanchez's research on maternal wellness shows that flexible, evolving approaches succeed while rigid programs fail. Your plan must grow with you.

Think of wellness like seasons:
- Winter: Rest, restoration, minimal demands
- Spring: Gentle growth, new practices
- Summer: Full bloom, more energy for wellness
- Fall: Harvest what works, release what doesn't

Honor your current season while planning for the next.

## The Five Pillars of Maternal Wellness (3 minutes)

Your sustainable plan rests on five interconnected pillars:

**1. Physical Wellness**
Not about "bouncing back" but supporting your body:
- Movement that feels good (walk, dance, stretch, swim)
- Nutrition that nourishes (not diets)
- Sleep optimization (quality over quantity)
- Medical care (checkups, therapy, medication if needed)

**2. Emotional Wellness**
Tending your inner landscape:
- Daily emotional check-ins
- Regular therapy or support groups
- Journaling or creative expression
- Boundaries that protect your energy

**3. Social Wellness**
Connection is not luxury:
- Weekly contact with support system
- Regular adult conversation
- Community involvement
- Asking for and accepting help

**4. Intellectual Wellness**
Keeping your mind engaged:
- Reading (even 5 minutes daily)
- Podcasts during feeding/walking
- Learning something new
- Work or volunteer engagement

**5. Spiritual Wellness**
Whatever connects you to meaning:
- Nature time
- Meditation or prayer
- Creative practice
- Service to others
- Gratitude rituals

Balance doesn't mean equal attention to all pillars daily. It means not abandoning any completely.

## Creating Your Minimum Baseline (2 minutes)

Let's establish your non-negotiable minimums - what you need to not just survive, but maintain basic wellness:

**Daily Minimums** (pick 3-5):
- 5-minute morning practice (stretch, breathe, journal)
- One nutritious meal
- Brief outdoor time
- Connection with one adult
- Hygiene routine that makes you feel human
- Medication/supplements
- 2-minute evening gratitude

**Weekly Minimums** (pick 3-5):
- One hour of solo time
- Movement 3x (even 10 minutes)
- Deeper connection with partner/friend
- Something creative or playful
- Meal planning/prep
- Therapy or support group
- One thing just for joy

These minimums are your foundation. On hard days, just hit these. On good days, build from here.

Dr. Pooja Lakshmin calls this "Real Self-Care" - not face masks and bubble baths, but boundaries, values alignment, and sustainable practices.

## The Flexibility Framework (1.5 minutes)

Your plan needs built-in flexibility:

**The Good Day/Hard Day/Medium Day Approach**:

*Good Day Plan*: Energy available, baby cooperating
- Full morning routine
- 30-minute walk
- Healthy meals
- Creative project time
- Partner connection

*Medium Day Plan*: Average energy, some challenges
- Abbreviated morning routine
- 10-minute outdoor time
- One healthy meal
- Text friend
- Early bedtime

*Hard Day Plan*: Survival mode activated
- Brush teeth
- Eat something
- Go outside briefly
- Ask for help
- No guilt

Having all three plans prevents all-or-nothing thinking.

**The Seasonal Adjustment**:
- Summer: More outdoor time, social activities
- Winter: Indoor movement, cozy self-care
- Baby developmental leaps: Lower expectations
- Illness/travel: Minimum baseline only

## Building Support Systems Into Your Plan (1.5 minutes)

Sustainable wellness requires support:

**Accountability Partners**:
- Weekly check-ins with mom friend
- Partner involvement in your wellness
- Online community participation
- Professional support team

**Practical Support**:
- Childcare for wellness activities
- Meal sharing with friends
- Exercise buddy system
- Skill swapping with other parents

**Emergency Support**:
- Crisis plan for bad days
- List of people to call
- Professional resources ready
- Self-care kit prepared

**Regular Support**:
- Scheduled therapy/counseling
- Standing playdates
- Recurring help (cleaning, meals)
- Planned respite time

Remember: Using support IS wellness, not weakness.

## Making It Sustainable (1.5 minutes)

Sustainability secrets:

**Start Stupidly Small**: Better to do 2 minutes daily than 30 minutes once. Consistency trumps intensity.

**Stack Habits**: Attach wellness to existing routines. Squats while baby plays, meditation while nursing, gratitude during coffee.

**Track Simply**: Check marks on calendar, not elaborate systems. Progress, not perfection.

**Adjust Frequently**: Monthly review - what's working? What's not? What needs tweaking?

**Celebrate Small Wins**: Walked around block? Win. Drank water? Win. Asked for help? Major win.

**Include pleasure**: Wellness shouldn't feel like punishment. Find movement you enjoy, self-care that actually feels caring.

Dr. BJ Fogg's behavior research shows tiny habits create lasting change. Your wellness plan should feel manageable, not overwhelming.

## Closing (30 seconds)

This week, create your personal wellness plan. Start with minimum baselines, add flexibility options, identify support needs. Write it down. Share it with someone. Begin with one tiny practice.

Remember: Wellness isn't a destination you reach. It's a practice you return to, again and again, with compassion for wherever you are today.

Next lesson, we'll prepare for future challenges. For now, trust that small, consistent acts of self-care compound into profound transformation.
