# Week 6, Lesson 1: Celebrating Your Growth & Resilience
*Video Script - 10 minutes*

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Welcome to our final week together. I'm Dr. Jana Rundle, and before we look forward, we need to look back - not to dwell, but to witness how far you've come.

If you're thinking "I haven't made progress" or "I'm still struggling" - this lesson will help you see what's invisible from inside the journey: your remarkable transformation and resilience.

## The Invisibility of Growth (2 minutes)

Here's why you might not see your progress:

**The Water You Swim In**: When change is gradual and daily, you don't notice it. Like your baby's growth - invisible day to day, obvious in monthly photos.

**The Negativity Bias**: Our brains evolved to notice problems, not progress. You'll remember the one bad day, not the six manageable ones.

**The Moving Goalpost**: As you grow, your standards rise. What devastated you three months ago might only frustrate you now - that's growth, even if the feeling is similar.

**The Comparison Trap**: You compare your insides to others' outsides, your struggles to their highlights.

Dr. Carol Dweck's research on growth mindset shows that recognizing progress - even small steps - accelerates future growth. Celebration isn't indulgence; it's fuel for continued development.

Let's make your invisible progress visible.

## Recognizing Your Growth (2.5 minutes)

Let's acknowledge what you've survived and how you've grown:

**Physical Resilience**:
- You grew and birthed (or received) a human being
- You've functioned on less sleep than prisoners of war
- You've healed from major physical events while caring for another
- You've fed your baby thousands of times
- Your body has adapted to demands you never imagined

**Emotional Growth**:
- You've felt depths of love you didn't know existed
- You've survived anxiety, worry, possibly depression
- You've managed rage without harm
- You've navigated identity loss and reconstruction
- You've held multiple conflicting emotions simultaneously

**Skill Development**:
- You've learned to decode baby's cries
- You can change diapers in the dark
- You've become an efficiency expert by necessity
- You've learned to function while exhausted
- You've developed intuition about your baby's needs

**Relationship Evolution**:
- You've renegotiated your partnership
- You've set boundaries with family
- You've found or created community
- You've asked for help (even if imperfectly)
- You've learned who your real support system is

Each of these represents massive growth. You're not the same person who brought baby home.

## The Strength Inventory (2 minutes)

Let's identify strengths you've developed:

**Adaptability**: You've adjusted to constant change - feeding schedules, sleep patterns, developmental leaps. This flexibility is a superpower.

**Prioritization**: You've learned what truly matters. This clarity will serve you forever.

**Efficiency**: You can accomplish in 20 minutes what used to take hours. This skill translates everywhere.

**Intuition**: You've developed a sixth sense about your baby. Trust this growing intuition.

**Advocacy**: You've learned to speak up for your baby's needs. This courage extends to self-advocacy.

**Resilience**: You've survived your worst days. You have evidence of your capability.

**Compassion**: Your heart has expanded. This includes self-compassion, even if still developing.

**Presence**: You've learned to find moments of connection amidst chaos. This is mindfulness in action.

These aren't just parenting skills. They're life skills that will serve you in every arena.

## Celebrating Without Conditions (1.5 minutes)

Here's what celebration doesn't require:
- Feeling "done" or "fixed"
- Having everything figured out
- No longer struggling
- Meeting arbitrary milestones
- Others' recognition or validation

Celebration is simply acknowledging: "I've come this far. That matters."

**Ways to Celebrate Your Growth**:
- Write yourself a letter acknowledging your journey
- Create a photo timeline showing your evolution (not just baby's)
- Share your growth with someone who's witnessed it
- List 10 things you can do now that you couldn't before
- Give yourself a symbolic gift representing your strength
- Have a "graduation" ceremony from early postpartum

Dr. Bren√© Brown's research shows that celebrating ordinary moments of resilience builds shame resilience. You don't need extraordinary achievements - surviving is extraordinary enough.

## Learning from Your Journey (1.5 minutes)

Your struggles haven't been meaningless. They've been teachers:

**What has your anxiety taught you?**
Perhaps about your deep love, your need for support, or your capacity to seek help.

**What has exhaustion shown you?**
Maybe your limits, the importance of rest, or your ability to function despite depletion.

**What have your hardest days revealed?**
Possibly your strength, your support system, or areas needing attention.

**What has your identity crisis gifted you?**
Perhaps clarity about values, freedom from others' expectations, or authentic self-discovery.

Psychologist Viktor Frankl wrote: "In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning."

Your struggles have created the strong, aware, capable mother sitting here today.

## Closing (30 seconds)

Your assignment: This week, create one tangible acknowledgment of your growth. Write it, create it, share it - but mark this milestone.

You've survived 100% of your worst days. You've grown in ways you couldn't imagine. You've become someone your pre-baby self would admire.

Next lesson, we'll build your sustainable wellness plan. But today, just breathe and acknowledge: You've done the impossible, daily. You're extraordinary.
