# Week 6, Lesson 4: Your Continued Journey & Resources
*Video Script - 12 minutes*

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Here we are, at the end of our six weeks together, but really at the beginning of your ongoing journey. I'm Dr. Jana Rundle, and it's been an honor to walk alongside you.

Today isn't goodbye - it's a graduation. You're leaving with tools, insights, and most importantly, the knowledge that you have everything within you to thrive.

## Reflecting on Your Journey (2 minutes)

Take a moment to honor where you've been:

**Week 1**: You learned to understand your fourth trimester, normalizing the intensity of postpartum changes.

**Week 2**: You developed self-compassion and built your coping toolkit, learning to be kind to yourself in struggle.

**Week 3**: You mapped your support needs and learned to build your village, even in isolation.

**Week 4**: You understood anxiety as protection gone haywire and learned to calm your nervous system.

**Week 5**: You explored matrescence, grieved losses, and integrated your evolving identity.

**Week 6**: You celebrated growth, created sustainable wellness plans, and prepared for future challenges.

That's profound work completed while caring for a baby. You've been in graduate school for the soul.

Dr. Daniel Siegel says, "Where attention goes, neural firing flows, and neural connection grows." You've literally rewired your brain through this focused attention on growth.

## The Ongoing Nature of Healing (2 minutes)

Here's what I want you to know about healing and growth:

**It's Not Linear**: You'll have setbacks. Days where old patterns return. This isn't failure - it's the spiral nature of growth. You return to similar places at higher levels of awareness.

**It's Not Complete**: There's no finish line marked "Healed!" or "Perfect Mother!" Growth is lifelong. What matters is direction, not destination.

**It's Not Solitary**: Healing happens in relationship - with yourself, your baby, your support system. Connection is the context for transformation.

**It's Not Serious All the Time**: Healing includes joy, laughter, playfulness. The light moments are as important as the deep work.

Dr. Bessel van der Kolk reminds us: "Being able to feel safe with other people is probably the single most important aspect of mental health."

Your journey continues best in community.

## When to Seek Additional Support (2 minutes)

While this course provides education and support, sometimes you need more:

**Seek Professional Help If**:
- Intrusive thoughts increase or scare you
- You can't sleep even when baby does
- Sadness or anxiety doesn't lift after 2 weeks
- You feel disconnected from baby persistently
- Rage feels uncontrollable
- You have thoughts of harming yourself or baby

**Types of Professional Support**:
- **Individual Therapy**: For processing your specific experience
- **Group Therapy**: For connection and shared healing
- **Couples Therapy**: For relationship navigation
- **Medication Support**: Sometimes necessary and always valid
- **Intensive Programs**: For more acute needs

There's no shame in needing more support. You deserve whatever level of care helps you thrive.

## Creating Your Ongoing Practice (1.5 minutes)

As you continue beyond this course:

**Weekly Rituals**:
- Review one lesson that speaks to current challenges
- Connect with one person from your support network
- Do one thing that honors your non-mom identity
- Practice one stress-management technique
- Celebrate one growth moment

**Monthly Check-Ins**:
- How is my mental health?
- What support do I need?
- What's working well?
- What needs adjustment?
- How have I grown?

**Quarterly Reviews**:
- Revisit your values
- Adjust your wellness plan
- Celebrate major growth
- Plan for upcoming challenges
- Reconnect with your why

**Annual Reflection**:
- Write letter to past self
- Document your transformation
- Set intentions (not resolutions)
- Honor your journey
- Dream forward

These practices keep you connected to your growth path.

## Your Graduation Ceremony (1.5 minutes)

Let's mark this moment:

**Acknowledge What You've Completed**: Six weeks of showing up for yourself while caring for another human. That's heroic.

**Claim Your Wisdom**: You're leaving with tools, insights, and experiential knowledge. You're different than when you started.

**Set an Intention**: Not a goal, but a direction. Perhaps: "I will continue treating myself with compassion" or "I will keep building my village."

**Create a Symbol**: Maybe it's:
- A piece of jewelry representing your strength
- A photo of yourself to honor your journey
- A plant representing ongoing growth
- A stone carrying your intention

**Share Your Achievement**: Tell someone what you've completed. Let yourself be witnessed and celebrated.

You've graduated from the University of Early Motherhood with honors.

## Closing Message (1 minute)

As we close, I want to leave you with this:

You are not the same person who started this course. You've grown in ways visible and invisible. You've developed strength, wisdom, and compassion that will serve you and your child for years to come.

The journey of motherhood is long and winding. There will be hard days ahead. But now you have tools, you have community, you have the knowledge that you can survive difficult things.

Most importantly, you have yourself - a self who is learning, growing, becoming. A self who deserves kindness, support, and celebration.

Thank you for trusting me with your journey. Thank you for doing this profound work. Thank you for becoming the mother your child needs - imperfect, growing, real, and deeply loved.

This isn't goodbye. It's "until we meet again" - in your continued practice, in your ongoing growth, in the mother you're still becoming.

Go gently. Go bravely. You've got this.

With deep respect and admiration,
Dr. Jana Rundle
