# Week 2, Lesson 5: Creating Your Coping Toolkit
*Video Script - 11 minutes*

## Introduction (30 seconds)

Welcome to our final lesson of Week 2. We've covered a lot - self-compassion, perfectionism, stress, emotions. Now it's time to put it all together into something practical: your personalized coping toolkit.

This isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. This is about finding what works for YOU, in YOUR life, with YOUR baby.

## What Is a Coping Toolkit? (1 minute)

Think of a coping toolkit like a first aid kit for your mental health. Just as you keep band-aids for cuts and ice packs for bumps, you need ready strategies for the inevitable challenges of motherhood.

Your toolkit includes:
- Quick techniques for immediate relief
- Daily practices for resilience
- Emergency plans for crisis moments
- Resources for ongoing support

The key is having these ready BEFORE you need them. Because when you're in the thick of it, you won't remember that breathing technique you read about once. But if it's in your toolkit, practiced and ready, it becomes automatic.

## Building Your Foundation (2 minutes)

Every good toolkit starts with basics that work for most situations:

**The Daily Five** - Pick one from each category:

1. **Morning Anchor** (2-5 minutes):
   - Stretch in bed before getting up
   - Three gratitudes while making coffee
   - Affirmation in the mirror
   - Deep breathing while baby first nurses

2. **Midday Reset** (30 seconds-2 minutes):
   - Physiological sigh before afternoon feeding
   - Quick body scan during baby's tummy time
   - Text a friend one honest sentence
   - Step outside for fresh air

3. **Movement Moment** (5-10 minutes):
   - Walk with baby carrier
   - Kitchen dance party
   - Yoga on living room floor
   - Gentle stretches while baby plays

4. **Connection Touch** (varies):
   - Voice message to friend
   - Video call with family
   - Mom group check-in
   - Partner hug for 20 seconds

5. **Evening Wind-Down** (5-10 minutes):
   - Journal three sentences
   - Bath or shower mindfully
   - Gentle music while feeding
   - Progressive muscle relaxation

These aren't extras. They're maintenance. Like brushing teeth for mental health.

## Your Quick-Relief Menu (2 minutes)

For immediate relief, you need options that take 30 seconds to 3 minutes:

**When Anxious/Panicked**:
- 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8)
- Ice cube on wrist
- Name 5 blue things you see
- Shake whole body for 30 seconds

**When Rageful/Frustrated**:
- Push against wall hard for 10 seconds
- Scream into pillow
- Rip up paper
- Stomp feet 20 times

**When Numb/Disconnected**:
- Smell strong peppermint oil
- Splash cold water on face
- Do 10 jumping jacks
- Call someone and say "I need to hear your voice"

**When Overwhelmed/Crying**:
- Hand on heart, say "This is temporary"
- Wrap in blanket tightly
- Rock yourself gently
- Let tears flow without story

Write these on index cards. Put them everywhere - bathroom, kitchen, diaper bag. When you need them, you won't have to think.

## The Emergency Plan (2 minutes)

Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we hit crisis. You need a plan for when:
- You're having thoughts of harm
- You can't stop crying
- You feel unsafe
- You're completely overwhelmed

**Your Crisis Card** should include:

1. **Safe Person to Call**:
   - Name: _______
   - Number: _______
   - Backup: _______

2. **Professional Support**:
   - Therapist: _______
   - Postpartum support line: 1-800-944-4773
   - Crisis line: 988
   - OB/Midwife emergency: _______

3. **Immediate Safety Steps**:
   - Put baby in safe place (crib)
   - Step into another room
   - Call someone
   - Use cold water/ice
   - Remember: "This feeling will pass"

4. **After-Crisis Care**:
   - No shame or judgment
   - Extra rest
   - Gentle nutrition
   - Follow-up with support

Having this plan isn't pessimistic. It's protective.

## Customizing Your Toolkit (2 minutes)

Your toolkit should reflect YOUR life:

**Consider Your Reality**:
- How much time do you actually have?
- What's your living situation?
- Who's available to help?
- What are your biggest triggers?
- What's worked in the past?

**Match Tools to Moments**:
- While nursing: breathing, visualization, music
- While baby sleeps: bath, journal, yoga
- While baby plays: movement, stretches, calls
- While pumping: meditation, reading, TV
- While walking: mindfulness, podcasts, silence

**Account for Barriers**:
- No time? 30-second techniques
- No space? Bathroom strategies
- No support? Online resources
- No energy? Lowest-effort options
- No money? Free resources only

Your toolkit works when it fits your actual life, not your ideal life.

## Making It Stick (1.5 minutes)

The best toolkit is the one you actually use:

**Start Tiny**:
- Pick ONE daily practice
- Do it for one week
- Then add another
- Build slowly

**Stack Habits**:
- Breathe while coffee brews
- Stretch while baby does tummy time
- Gratitude during first morning feeding
- Link new habits to existing routines

**Track Simply**:
- Check mark on calendar
- Note in phone
- Sticker chart (yes, really)
- Whatever motivates you

**Adjust Often**:
- What's working?
- What's not?
- What needs tweaking?
- Toolkits evolve

**Share Accountability**:
- Tell someone your plan
- Check in weekly
- Celebrate small wins
- Normalize struggles

## The Power of Practice (1 minute)

Here's the secret: These tools work best when practiced during calm moments. Don't wait for crisis to try something new.

Practice breathing when you're not panicked. Practice grounding when you're not dissociated. Practice self-compassion when you're not struggling.

Think of it like fire drills. You practice when there's no fire so your body knows what to do when there is one.

Even 2 minutes of daily practice builds neural pathways that make these tools automatic when you need them most.

## Closing (30 seconds)

Your coping toolkit isn't about becoming a different person. It's about supporting the person you are through an incredibly challenging time.

Some days you'll use every tool. Some days you'll forget they exist. Both are okay. The toolkit is there when you need it, judgment-free and ready.

This week, start building your toolkit. Choose one daily practice. Write your crisis card. Try one quick relief technique. Small steps lead to big changes.

You've made it through another week. You're learning, growing, adapting. Next week, we'll explore building your support system - because no one should do this alone. Until then, be patient with yourself as you practice. You're doing the hard work of healing.
