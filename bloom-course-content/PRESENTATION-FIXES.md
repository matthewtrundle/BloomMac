# Presentation Formatting Fixes Applied

## Key Issues Resolved:

### 1. **Viewport Scaling**
- Changed Reveal.js dimensions from fixed `1920x1080` to responsive `100%`
- Set `minScale` and `maxScale` to 1 to prevent unwanted zooming
- Added proper flexbox centering to all sections

### 2. **Typography Sizing**
- Reduced oversized fonts using `clamp()` for responsive scaling
- Magazine title: `clamp(4rem, 8vw, 7rem)` → more reasonable sizes
- Display titles: `clamp(3rem, 6vw, 5rem)` → prevents overflow
- Body text properly scaled for readability

### 3. **Layout Fixes**
- Changed `position: absolute` to `position: fixed` for full-screen overlays
- Added proper padding to prevent edge cutoff
- Grid layouts now have responsive gaps and max-widths
- Fixed image paths from `../../../../shared-assets/` to `../../../shared-assets/`

### 4. **Image Display**
- All images now properly reference the correct path
- Full-bleed backgrounds work correctly
- Grid images scale properly within containers
- Removed unnecessary margins that broke layouts

### 5. **Component Improvements**
- Statistics cards now in a proper 2x2 grid instead of floating
- Timeline properly centered with responsive sizing
- Emotional reality grid uses flexible columns
- All text is now readable against backgrounds
