# Complete Recovery Plan for Bloom Psychology Site

## Current Situation
The site is showing 404 errors despite successful builds. This indicates component rendering issues rather than build errors.

## Every Change Made During Optimization

### 1. Package Changes
- **Added:** @next/bundle-analyzer, cross-env
- **Downgraded:** React from 19.0.0 to 18.3.1, react-dom from 19.0.0 to 18.3.1
- **Removed:** framer-motion
- **Updated:** React types from ^19 to ^18.3.21, react-dom types from ^19 to ^18.3.7

### 2. File Changes Made

#### next.config.ts
- Added image optimization settings
- Added SWC minify
- Added browser caching headers
- Added bundle analyzer integration

#### package.json
- Added "analyze" script
- Updated React versions
- Removed framer-motion dependency

#### app/page.tsx
- Removed 'use client' directive
- Removed framer-motion imports and motion components
- Simplified to server component
- Fixed service.image → service.heroImage
- Fixed service.link → `/services/${service.slug}`

#### Many Component Files
- Removed framer-motion dependencies from:
  - components/layout/Header.tsx
  - components/layout/ConsultLauncher.tsx
  - components/ui/Button.tsx
  - components/ui/KineticTypography.tsx
  - components/ui/OrganicShape.tsx
  - components/ui/ParallaxContainer.tsx
  - app/faq/page.tsx

#### components/ui/CardAccent.tsx
- Changed font-script → font-playfair italic

## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Complete Git Reset (SAFEST)
```bash
cd /Users/mattrundle/Documents/Bloom
git reset --hard HEAD~5
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Manual Recovery
```bash
# 1. Restore package.json to original state
git checkout HEAD~5 -- package.json package-lock.json

# 2. Clean install
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install

# 3. Restore key files
git checkout HEAD~5 -- app/page.tsx
git checkout HEAD~5 -- components/

# 4. Start server
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Fix Current State
1. Check why the page is 404ing by examining the routing
2. Verify app/page.tsx exists and exports correctly
3. Check for any hydration mismatches
4. Ensure all imports resolve correctly

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **React Version Incompatibility**: React 19 breaks framer-motion
2. **Aggressive Optimization**: Removed client components without proper testing
3. **Cascading Failures**: Each fix created new issues
4. **Type Mismatches**: React types didn't match runtime versions

## Immediate Actions Needed

### Step 1: Confirm File Structure
```bash
ls -la app/
ls -la app/page.tsx
```

### Step 2: Check for Console Errors
```bash
# Check dev server logs for specific errors
# Look for module resolution issues
```

### Step 3: Verify Route Registration
- Ensure app/page.tsx is properly exporting
- Check if file permissions are correct
- Verify Next.js can find the page

### Step 4: Test Minimal Page
```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Test</h1>;
}
```

## Recommended Recovery Path

1. **Git Reset (Option 1)** - This will restore everything to a known working state
2. Document the current project state before reset
3. Implement optimizations incrementally:
   - Image optimization only
   - Font optimization only
   - Code splitting only
   - Test each change thoroughly

## Lessons for Future Optimizations

1. Always create a backup branch before major changes
2. Test each optimization individually
3. Never upgrade major versions during optimization
4. Keep client/server boundaries intact
5. Respect library compatibility requirements

## Commands for Full Recovery

```bash
# Save current state
git stash

# Reset to working state
git reset --hard HEAD~5

# Clean everything
rm -rf node_modules .next

# Fresh install
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev
```

This will restore your site to exactly how it was before we started the optimization process.
