# Rate Limiting Implementation

## ✅ Completed: Rate Limiting for Public Endpoints

### What Was Implemented

Created a comprehensive rate limiting system to protect public endpoints from spam and abuse.

### Rate Limiting Library
**File:** `/lib/rate-limit.ts`

Features:
- In-memory rate limit tracking (upgradeable to Redis)
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries
- Configurable limits per endpoint type
- Standard HTTP 429 responses with retry headers

### Rate Limits Applied

| Endpoint | Limit | Time Window | Purpose |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Contact Form** | 3 requests | per hour | Prevent spam submissions |
| **Newsletter Signup** | 5 requests | per hour | Allow legitimate signups |
| **Career Applications** | 2 requests | per hour | Prevent application spam |
| **General Email Send** | 10 requests | per minute | More lenient for internal use |
| **Login** (future) | 5 attempts | per 15 minutes | Brute force protection |
| **Signup** (future) | 3 requests | per hour | Prevent account creation spam |

### Protected Endpoints

✅ **Contact Form** (`/app/api/contact/submit/route.ts`)
- Returns friendly error message with retry time
- Tracks by IP address

✅ **Newsletter Signup** (`/pages/api/newsletter-signup.ts`)
- Prevents email bombing
- Includes proper HTTP headers

✅ **Career Applications** (`/app/api/careers/apply/route.ts`)
- Limits job application spam
- Protects file upload endpoint

✅ **Email Send** (`/pages/api/send-email.ts`)
- General email endpoint protection
- More lenient limits for functionality

### Response Format

When rate limit is exceeded:
```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests",
  "message": "Please wait before submitting another contact form. Try again after 3:45 PM."
}
```

HTTP Headers included:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: When limit resets (ISO 8601)
- `Retry-After`: Seconds until retry allowed

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { rateLimit, RATE_LIMITS } from '@/lib/rate-limit';

// In your API route
const rateLimitResult = await rateLimit(RATE_LIMITS.contact, identifier);

if (!rateLimitResult.success) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Too many requests' },
    { status: 429 }
  );
}
```

### Testing Rate Limits

To test rate limiting:

1. **Contact Form**: Submit 4 times within an hour
2. **Newsletter**: Sign up 6 times within an hour
3. **Career Application**: Apply 3 times within an hour

You should receive a 429 error with retry information.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Redis Integration**: For distributed systems
2. **User-based Limits**: Different limits for authenticated users
3. **Dynamic Limits**: Adjust based on system load
4. **Monitoring**: Track rate limit violations
5. **Allowlist**: Exempt certain IPs/users

### Security Benefits

- ✅ Prevents spam and abuse
- ✅ Protects against DoS attacks
- ✅ Reduces server load
- ✅ Improves email deliverability
- ✅ Protects database from junk data

The rate limiting system is now active and protecting your public endpoints from abuse.
