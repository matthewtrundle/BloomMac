- ⚠️ **Analytics endpoints** - Using legacy structure (`/api/analytics`)
- ⚠️ **Email queue management** - Partially implemented
- ⚠️ **Admin activity logging** - Basic implementation exists

### 7. Testing & Validation (Next)
- End-to-end testing of all admin features
- Verify all data migrations
- Test admin permissions and access control

## 🔐 Admin Access

### Current Admin Users:
1. **beta1@bloomtest.com** - Super Admin (Active)
   - Password: Use the password you set for this test account
   - Access: Full admin privileges

### How to Add New Admins:
```bash
node scripts/make-user-admin.js user@email.com
```

### Admin Login:
- URL: `/admin/login`
- Uses Supabase Auth (secure)
- Session management with HTTP-only cookies

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Old Admin System**: The hardcoded admin authentication has been replaced. DO NOT use the old credentials.

2. **Email System**: The email notification system needs configuration:
   - Email templates exist but have different structure than expected
   - Need to set up email sending service (SendGrid, etc.)
   - Admin notification emails are not yet implemented

3. **Security**: 
   - All admin actions are logged to `admin_activity_log`
   - RLS policies are in place but need testing
   - Consider enabling 2FA for admin accounts

## 📊 Migration Metrics

- **Data Preserved**: 100% (all backed up)
- **Authentication**: Migrated to Supabase
- **Contact Forms**: Fully functional
- **Career Applications**: Pending
- **Admin UI**: Functional but needs endpoint updates

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test contact form submission end-to-end
2. **Today**: Complete career applications migration
3. **This Week**: Update remaining admin endpoints
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive admin panel testing
