# Phase 2 Security Deployment Checklist

## Overview
This document outlines the deployment process for Phase 2 security enhancements to production.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Code Review ✅
- [x] All security headers implemented
- [x] RLS policies created and tested
- [x] Request validation middleware in place
- [x] CORS configuration complete
- [x] Rate limiting implemented
- [x] All tests passing

### 2. Dependencies ✅
- [x] Next.js updated to 15.3.5 (security fix)
- [x] No remaining vulnerabilities (npm audit clean)
- [x] All packages up to date

### 3. Testing Complete ✅
- [x] Security audit script: 100% pass rate
- [x] Wellness Hub features: All working with RLS
- [x] Provider Dashboard: Authentication and authorization working
- [x] Rate limiting: Properly blocking excessive requests

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run the RLS migration on production
supabase migration up 20250105_phase2_rls_policies.sql --project-ref [PROJECT_REF]
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure production has these variables set:
- `JWT_SECRET` - Strong secret for admin JWT tokens
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - For server-side operations
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Public Supabase URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Public anon key

### 3. Deploy Application
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, etc.)
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Run Security Audit
```bash
AUDIT_URL=https://your-production-url.com node scripts/security-audit.js
```

#### Test Critical Paths
1. **Admin Login**: Verify admin can log in
2. **User Registration**: Test new user signup with RLS
3. **Contact Form**: Verify rate limiting is active
4. **Protected Routes**: Confirm unauthorized access is blocked

#### Monitor for Issues
- Check error logs for RLS policy violations
- Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
- Verify security headers in browser DevTools

### 5. Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Disable RLS policies if causing issues:
   ```sql
   -- Emergency RLS disable (use with caution)
   ALTER TABLE user_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   -- Repeat for other tables as needed
   ```

## Security Improvements Summary

### What's New
1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
2. **Security Headers**: Protection against XSS, clickjacking, etc.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
4. **Request Validation**: Input sanitization with Zod
5. **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin access

### Impact on Users
- No visible changes for legitimate users
- Better protection of user data
- Improved application security posture
- Faster response to security threats

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Set up alerts for**:
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - Rate limit violations
   - RLS policy violations
   - 500 errors that might indicate security issues

2. **Regular audits**:
   - Run security audit script monthly
   - Review admin activity logs
   - Check for new vulnerabilities with `npm audit`
