## 🎯 Expert Panel Insights

### 1. **Sarah Chen, UX Design Lead (Former Coursera)**

> "The current dashboard feels like disconnected features. Course-centric platforms succeed when they create a clear learning path. Think of it as a journey map, not a feature list."

**Key Recommendations:**
- **Hero Section**: Current course progress with visual journey map
- **Clear CTAs**: "Continue Learning" as primary action
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Courses first, resources second, community third
- **Progress Visualization**: Use journey metaphors (paths, gardens, growth)

### 2. **Dr. Michael Torres, Learning Platform Architect (MasterClass)**

> "Adult learners, especially busy mothers, need bite-sized wins and clear progress indicators. The platform should celebrate small victories and make returning effortless."

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Resume**: One-click to return to exact spot in course
- **Daily Learning Streaks**: Gentle encouragement, not pressure
- **Milestone Celebrations**: Unlock content/badges at key points
- **Learning Recommendations**: Based on progress and interests

### 3. **Jennifer Park, Product Strategy (Headspace)**

> "Wellness platforms work best when they feel like a supportive companion, not another task list. Integration should feel natural, not forced."

**Integration Strategy:**
- **Unified Progress**: All activities contribute to overall wellness score
- **Cross-Feature Benefits**: Course completion unlocks resources
- **Holistic Dashboard**: Shows learning, community, and personal growth
- **Contextual Resources**: Suggest resources based on current lesson

### 4. **Dr. Lisa Rodriguez, Mental Health Tech Specialist**

> "Mothers need validation and community. The platform should feel like a safe space where progress is celebrated, not compared."

**Wellness-Specific Features:**
- **Private Progress**: Option to share or keep private
- **Mood Check-ins**: Optional, tied to course content
- **Peer Support**: Course cohorts for shared experience
- **Professional Touchpoints**: Clear paths to 1:1 support when needed

### 5. **Amanda Swift, Brand Strategist**

> "The name 'Wellness Hub' is generic and clinical. You need something that speaks to transformation and growth."

**Naming Recommendations:**
1. **"My Growth Studio"** - Creative, personal, transformative
2. **"Learning Sanctuary"** - Safe space for growth
3. **"Journey Dashboard"** - Progress-focused
4. **"Bloom Academy"** - Ties to brand, educational
5. **"Transform Center"** - Action-oriented
