-- =====================================================
-- FIX BLOG ADMIN ACCESS
-- Your blog_posts table exists with correct schema
-- =====================================================

-- 1. Check current status
SELECT 
    'Blog posts table status:' as info,
    COUNT(*) as total_posts,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN featured THEN 1 END) as featured_posts,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN published_at <= NOW() THEN 1 END) as published_posts
FROM public.blog_posts;

-- 2. Check RLS status
SELECT 
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename = 'blog_posts';

-- 3. Disable RLS on blog_posts (blog content should be publicly readable)
ALTER TABLE public.blog_posts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Grant permissions to ensure access
GRANT ALL ON public.blog_posts TO postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;

-- 5. Check if there are any policies that might be interfering
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    cmd,
    qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename = 'blog_posts';

-- 6. Sample the data to ensure it's accessible
SELECT 
    id,
    title,
    slug,
    category,
    featured,
    published_at,
    created_at
FROM public.blog_posts
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 7. Create a test to ensure the service role can access
DO $$
DECLARE
    v_count integer;
BEGIN
    -- This simulates what the admin panel does
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count
    FROM public.blog_posts;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Blog posts accessible: % records', v_count;
    
    IF v_count = 0 THEN
        RAISE NOTICE '⚠️  No blog posts found, but table exists';
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE '✅ Blog posts are accessible!';
    END IF;
END $$;

-- 8. Check for any errors in the structure
SELECT 
    '=== Checking for common issues ===' as info;

-- Check if any required columns have mostly NULL values
SELECT 
    'Columns with NULL values:' as check_type,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN title IS NULL THEN 1 END) as null_titles,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN slug IS NULL THEN 1 END) as null_slugs,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN content IS NULL THEN 1 END) as null_content,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN published_at IS NULL THEN 1 END) as null_published
FROM public.blog_posts;

-- Final status
SELECT 
    '✅ Blog access should now work in admin panel!' as status,
    'If still having issues, check browser console for errors' as note;
