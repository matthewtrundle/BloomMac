- Workbook forms

Backend:
- User authentication (Supabase Auth)

## üîí **HIPAA COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS**

### When HIPAA Applies:
- ‚ùå Educational content = NOT covered by HIPAA
- ‚úÖ Personal health info in workbooks = POTENTIALLY covered
- ‚úÖ If you review/respond to health issues = COVERED

### HIPAA Requirements if Applicable:
1. **Business Associate Agreements** (BAAs)
   - Hosting provider (Vercel won't sign)
   - Database (Supabase WILL sign)
   - Email service
   - Any third-party tools

2. **Technical Safeguards**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Access controls and audit logs
   - Automatic logoff
   - Unique user IDs

3. **Administrative Safeguards**
   - Privacy policies
   - Training documentation
   - Incident response plan
   - Risk assessments

### SMART WORKAROUND:
**Make courses purely educational**
- Don't collect health information
- Workbooks = self-reflection only
- No therapist feedback on personal issues
- Clear disclaimers: "This is education, not therapy"

## üìö **WORKBOOK IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS**

### Option 1: Downloadable PDFs (Simple)
```
How it works:
1. Student downloads PDF
2. Fills out on computer/prints
3. Keeps for personal use
4. No data collection = No HIPAA
```

### Option 2: Online Forms (Track Progress)
```typescript
// Database schema for workbook responses
interface WorkbookEntry {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  courseId: string;
  moduleNumber: number;
  responses: {
    question: string;
    answer: string;
    timestamp: Date;
  }[];
  completedAt: Date;
}

// Features:
- Save progress
- Return later
- View past entries
- Track completion
```

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- PDFs for sensitive content
- Online for progress tracking
- Clear separation of educational vs. personal data
