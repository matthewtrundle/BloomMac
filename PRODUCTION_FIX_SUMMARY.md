# 🔥 Bloom Production Fix - Executive Summary

## The Problem
Your production site is experiencing database connection failures affecting 93% of features. Local testing shows the code works fine (92.9% pass rate), indicating the issues are environment/configuration related, not code problems.

## Root Causes (In Order of Priority)
1. **Missing Environment Variables** - Supabase clients can't initialize
2. **Broken RLS Policies** - Service role checks using wrong syntax
3. **Authentication Conflicts** - Multiple auth systems interfering
4. **Schema Mismatches** - Production missing columns/tables

## Immediate Actions (Do in This Order)

### 1️⃣ Fix Environment Variables (5 minutes)
In your hosting provider (Vercel/Netlify), ensure these are set:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://utetcmirepwdxbtrcczv.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[get from Supabase dashboard]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[get from Supabase dashboard]
```

### 2️⃣ Deploy Health Check Endpoint (10 minutes)
1. Copy `lib/supabase-unified.ts` to your project
2. Copy `pages/api/health/database.ts` to your project  
3. Deploy to production
4. Visit: `https://your-site.com/api/health/database`

### 3️⃣ Run Emergency SQL Fixes (15 minutes)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `emergency-production-fixes.sql`
3. Run the script
4. Check the output for any errors

### 4️⃣ Deploy Emergency Newsletter Fix (10 minutes)
1. Copy `pages/api/emergency/fix-newsletter.ts`
2. Deploy to production
3. Test newsletter signup immediately
