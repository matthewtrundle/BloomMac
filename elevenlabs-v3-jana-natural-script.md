## NATURAL MOM CONVERSATION SCRIPT:

[Soft ambient kitchen sounds - coffee brewing, dishes clinking gently]

**Jessica:** [sighs heavily] Jana, I need to talk to you. Not as... not as a psychologist but just as a mom. [pause] I completely froze when Lily asked about Camp Mystic yesterday.

**Jana:** [exhales knowingly] Oh Jessica... [pause] You want to know something? So did I. [laughs softly] PhD in psychology and I just stood there in my kitchen like—[trails off]

**Jessica:** [surprised] Wait, really? You too?

**Jana:** [vulnerable] My daughter came home from her friend's house asking about it and I... [voice catches] I literally couldn't speak for a second. Just kept thinking about those parents and—

**Jessica:** [overlapping] —yes! And then you spiral because you're imagining—

**Jana:** [continuing] —every worst-case scenario. [pause] [quietly] I couldn't sleep that night.

**Jessica:** [relieved exhale] Thank God it's not just me. I've been doom-scrolling at 2 AM like some kind of—

**Jana:** [interrupting gently] Jessica, that's... [professional creeping in] that's actually completely normal. [catches herself] Sorry, I just went into therapist mode, didn't I? [self-deprecating laugh]

**Jessica:** [laughing] No, please! I need both right now. Friend-Jana AND Dr. Jana.

**Jana:** [sighs] Okay, well... [shifts between roles] as your friend, I've been a total mess about this too. But as a psychologist? [pause] What we're feeling makes complete sense.

**Jessica:** How do you mean?

**Jana:** [thoughtful] Kids are like little emotional barometers. They pick up on everything we're not saying. [personal] My daughter knew something was wrong before I even—

**Jessica:** [cutting in anxiously] But what do we SAY? Like, Sophie already knows something happened and I can't just—

**Jana:** [grounding voice] Okay. [breath] This is what worked with mine. For little ones—Sophie's what, seven?

**Jessica:** Six.

**Jana:** Perfect. So for her age, I kept it super simple. [demonstrating] "There was a big storm that made the water rise really fast. Some people got hurt, but lots of helpers came right away."

**Jessica:** [processing] That's... that's it?

**Jana:** [firm but gentle] That's it. They don't need more. [pause] [softer] They really don't.

**Jessica:** [uncertain] But what if she asks—

**Jana:** [reassuring] Then you follow her lead. [sharing] My daughter asked if it could happen here. I showed her how far we are from rivers, talked about our weather alerts... [trails off] Gave her some control back.

**Jessica:** [recognition] Oh! Like Mr. Rogers said—look for the helpers.

**Jana:** [smiling in voice] Exactly. [pause] Though I'll be honest? [laughs nervously] I had to practice saying it without my voice shaking.

**Jessica:** [laughs] God, the pressure to be calm when you're internally screaming...

**Jana:** [rueful] Right? And here's the thing—[more animated] they KNOW when we're faking it. It's better to say "This makes me sad too" than pretend everything's fine.

**Jessica:** [surprised] Really?

**Jana:** [confident] Kids find honesty reassuring. It's the pretending that scares them. [pause] [vulnerable again] Though I maybe learned that the hard way when I tried to be "super mom" and my daughter called me out on it.

**Jessica:** [laughing] She called you out?

**Jana:** [laughing too] She literally said "Mommy, your happy voice sounds weird." [both laughing] Out of the mouths of babes...

[pause as laughter settles]

**Jessica:** [serious again] Okay but... [hesitant] what about the doom-scrolling? Because I cannot stop checking for updates and—

**Jana:** [sighs deeply] Oh, Jessica. [pause] Can I tell you what I did?

**Jessica:** Please.

**Jana:** [slightly embarrassed] I set a tea timer. [Jessica: "A what?"] Seriously! When I want to check news, I make tea instead. The whole ritual—boiling water, steeping, sitting with the warm cup... [trails off] It takes about five minutes and usually the urge passes.

**Jessica:** [skeptical but intrigued] Does that actually work?

**Jana:** [honest] About 70% of the time? [laughs] The other 30% I check anyway but at least I'm caffeinated.

**Jessica:** [laughing] There's the real mom advice!

**Jana:** [shifting serious] But really, we have to manage our own anxiety first. [gentle] We can't pour from an empty cup, you know?

**Jessica:** [thoughtful] My sister keeps sending me articles about talking to kids about tragedy and I just... [frustrated] they all say different things!

**Jana:** [understanding laugh] Oh, the information overload! [pause] Here's what no article tells you—you know your kid best. [firm but kind] Trust that knowledge.

**Jessica:** [skeptical] But what if I say the wrong thing?

**Jana:** [reassuring] You probably will. [Jessica gasps] No, really! I told my daughter "everything's okay" when clearly it wasn't. She looked at me like I'd grown two heads. [both laugh] Kids appreciate honesty over perfection.

**Jessica:** [sighs] I know, I just... [voice breaking] I had a complete breakdown in the shower yesterday. Just sobbing.

**Jana:** [softly] Good.

**Jessica:** [startled] Good?!

**Jana:** [affirming] Yes. Good. You let it move through you. [pause] Better there than in front of Sophie before she's ready to see that.

**Jessica:** [considering] I... hadn't thought of it that way.

**Jana:** [sharing] I've cried twice. Once in my car after drop-off, once making dinner. [pause] My husband found me crying into the pasta water. [both laugh softly]

**Jessica:** [after pause] What do we DO though? Like, with the kids? To help them process?

**Jana:** [brightening] Oh! This is where it gets beautiful actually. [excited] Kids are amazing at finding their own ways to cope. Art, stories, play...

**Jessica:** [remembering] Wait, is that why Sophie's been playing "rescue camp" with her dolls?

**Jana:** [delighted] Yes! Exactly! She's processing through play. That's so healthy. [pause] My daughter wrote cards for the families. Completely her idea.

**Jessica:** [touched] Oh Jana, that's so sweet.

**Jana:** [proud but emotional] She asked if we could donate some of her camp supplies too. [voice catches] Seven years old and she's already thinking about how to help.

**Jessica:** [thoughtful] They really do show us the way sometimes, don't they?

**Jana:** [warmly] Every time. [pause] We think we need to have all the answers, but really? We just need to be present. To be honest. To show them it's okay to feel big feelings and still find ways to help.

**Jessica:** [sighs] This is hard.

**Jana:** [agreeing] So hard. [pause] But you called. You're asking. You're showing up. [firmly] That's what matters.

**Jessica:** [emotional] Thank you. For being both—friend and doctor.

**Jana:** [laughing softly] Occupational hazard. Can't turn it off completely. [pause] But honestly? Going through this as a mom has taught me more than any textbook.

**Jessica:** [curious] Yeah?

**Jana:** [reflective] All the theory in the world doesn't prepare you for your own kid looking up at you with those big eyes, asking questions that break your heart. [pause] But that's... that's where the real learning happens.

**Jessica:** [softly] In the messy middle of it all.

**Jana:** [affirming] Exactly. In the messy, imperfect, tea-timer-interrupted middle of it all.

[both laugh softly]

**Jessica:** [wrapping up] Should we... should we share this? Like, with other parents who might be struggling?

**Jana:** [thoughtful] You know what? Yes. [decided] Because if we're struggling—with all my training and your amazing mom instincts—others are too.

**Jessica:** [agreeing] No one should have to figure this out alone.

**Jana:** [warm] Never alone. [pause] That's what we're here for, right? Each other?

**Jessica:** [emotional] Right.

[pause]

**Jessica:** [sudden thought] Oh! What about older kids? My neighbor's son is 13 and he's been really anxious...

**Jana:** [thoughtful] Teenagers are tricky because they're seeing everything on social media. [pause] For them, it's more about processing together. Asking what they've heard, what worries them specifically...

**Jessica:** [understanding] Less protecting, more discussing?

**Jana:** [affirming] Exactly. And giving them ways to channel those feelings—volunteer opportunities, writing to representatives about safety measures... [pause] Active coping.

**Jessica:** [lightening] Better than my teen years of just writing angsty poetry.

**Jana:** [laughing] Hey, that's processing too! [both laugh] Whatever works, right?

[comfortable pause]

**Jana:** [gently] And Jessica? You're doing great. Sophie's lucky to have you.

**Jessica:** [softly] Thanks, Jana. [pause] Same to you.

[Sound of cups being gathered, chairs shifting]

**Jessica:** [decided] We should do this more often. Not just when tragedy strikes but... [trails off]

**Jana:** [warmly] Regular coffee and real talk? [pause] I'd love that.

**Jessica:** [smiling in voice] Deal. Next week?

**Jana:** [affirming] Next week. And Jessica? [pause] Bring the angsty poetry.

[Both laughing]

**Jessica:** [warmth in voice] You know what? I feel like I can actually handle bedtime questions tonight.

**Jana:** [gently proud] You always could. [pause] Sometimes we just need to hear it from someone else.

**Jessica:** [soft exhale] Yeah. [pause] Thanks for being my someone else.

**Jana:** [emotional but steady] Always, Jess. [pause] For what it's worth? This conversation helped me too. Sometimes the expert needs reminding that she's human first.

**Jessica:** [understanding] Mom first, psychologist second?

**Jana:** [affirming] Every single time.

[Quiet moment, coffee cups settling]

**Jessica:** [thoughtful] Our kids... they're going to be okay, aren't they?

**Jana:** [certain] They're going to be more than okay. [pause] They've got moms who show up, who ask the hard questions, who aren't afraid to not have all the answers. [softer] That's everything.

**Jessica:** [emotional] I needed to hear that.

**Jana:** [warm smile in voice] Me too. [pause] Me too.

[Final beat of comfortable silence]

**Jessica:** [lighter] Same time next week?

**Jana:** [matching energy] I'll bring the tea timer.

**Jessica:** [laughing] I'll bring the tissues.

**Jana:** [joining laughter] Perfect. [pause, sincere] Take care of yourself this week, okay?

**Jessica:** [equally sincere] You too, Jana. [pause] And thank you. Really.

**Jana:** [gentle] Thank you back. [pause] Text me if you need anything before next week. Middle of the night anxiety spirals included.

**Jessica:** [grateful laugh] Deal. [pause] Bye, friend.

**Jana:** [warm] Bye, Jess.

[Sound of footsteps, door closing gently, then quiet]
