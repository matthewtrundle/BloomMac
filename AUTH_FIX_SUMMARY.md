# Authentication Redirect Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were being redirected to the login page when clicking on Settings or Profile Edit links from the Dashboard, even though they were already logged in.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by inconsistent authentication state management across different pages:

1. **Dashboard page**: Uses `useAuth()` hook from AuthContext (centralized auth state)
2. **Settings page**: Was using `createClientComponentClient()` directly to check auth
3. **Profile Edit page**: Was also using `createClientComponentClient()` directly

This created race conditions where:
- The middleware would refresh the Supabase session
- The page would check auth state before the refresh completed
- The page would see no session and redirect to login
- Meanwhile, the AuthContext would have the correct user state

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `/app/settings/page.tsx`:
```typescript
// Before:
const supabase = createClientComponentClient();
const [user, setUser] = useState<any>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  const getUser = async () => {
    const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
    if (!session) {
      router.push('/auth/login');
    } else {
      setUser(session.user);
    }
  };
  getUser();
}, [router, supabase.auth]);

// After:
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';
const { user, loading: authLoading } = useAuth();

useEffect(() => {
  if (!authLoading && !user) {
    router.push('/auth/login');
  }
}, [user, authLoading, router]);
```

### 2. Updated `/app/profile/edit/page.tsx`:
Applied the same changes to use AuthContext instead of direct Supabase client auth checks.

## Benefits
1. **Consistent auth state**: All pages now use the same AuthContext
2. **No race conditions**: AuthContext handles session refresh properly
3. **Better UX**: No unexpected redirects when navigating between authenticated pages

## Testing Instructions
1. Clear browser cookies/storage
2. Log in to the application
3. Navigate to Dashboard
4. Click on Settings link - should work without redirect
5. Click on Edit Profile link - should work without redirect

## Additional Notes
- The middleware still handles Supabase session refresh for all routes
- AuthContext listens to auth state changes and updates accordingly
- This pattern should be used for all authenticated pages going forward

## Files Modified
- `/app/settings/page.tsx`
- `/app/profile/edit/page.tsx`

## Potential Issues to Monitor
If users still experience redirects:
1. Check if email confirmation is required in Supabase settings
2. Verify session cookies are being set properly
3. Check browser console for any auth-related errors
