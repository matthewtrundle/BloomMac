# Hero Parallax Effect Fix

## Overview
The hero section has been updated to use a true fixed background parallax effect where the hero image stays in place while content scrolls over it.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Fixed Background Position
- Changed from `position: absolute` to `position: fixed`
- Set `z-index: -1` to ensure it stays behind all content
- Image now remains stationary as user scrolls

### 2. Section Z-Index Management
- All sections after hero have `z-index: 10` 
- Ensures proper layering over the fixed background
- Introduction section has solid background to cover hero image

### 3. CSS Classes
- Added `.hero-section` class for specific targeting
- Updated CSS to handle fixed backgrounds properly
- Mobile fallback for better performance on devices

### 4. Key Changes Made:
```css
/* Fixed hero background */
.fixed inset-x-0 top-0 h-screen w-full z-[-1]

/* Sections with proper z-index */
section className="... relative z-10"
```

### 5. Background Coverage
- Introduction section uses solid gradient background
- All subsequent sections have opaque backgrounds
- Prevents hero image from showing through

## Behavior
- Hero image stays completely fixed during scroll
- Content sections slide up over the fixed image
- Creates illusion of depth and smooth scrolling
- Mobile devices use standard scrolling for performance

## Benefits
1. True parallax effect as requested
2. Smooth scrolling experience
3. Better performance than transform-based parallax
4. Works consistently across browsers
