# Slide Formatting & Fullscreen Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Slide Formatting
- Changed overflow from `hidden` to `auto` to allow scrolling on content that doesn't fit
- Added responsive font sizing using `clamp()` for better scaling
- Adjusted container max-widths to 90% for better fit
- Added proper box-sizing to all elements
- Reduced padding on mobile devices

### 2. Fullscreen Functionality
- Improved fullscreen toggle with proper async/await error handling
- Added fullscreen change event listener to sync state
- Fixed fullscreen-specific styles for proper display
- Added visual indicator showing "Press F for presentation mode"
- Hide progress bar in fullscreen mode for cleaner presentation

### 3. Container Improvements
- Changed slide background from gray to white for better contrast
- Added shadow to slide container for depth
- Made overflow scrollable for slides with lots of content
- Improved responsive breakpoints for mobile devices

## How to Use Fullscreen:

1. **Enter Fullscreen**: 
   - Click the fullscreen button (⛶) in the top-right
   - Or press 'F' key

2. **Navigate in Fullscreen**:
   - Use arrow keys (← →) to navigate
   - Press spacebar for next slide
   - Click navigation buttons at bottom

3. **Exit Fullscreen**:
   - Press ESC key
   - Or click the minimize button (⊟)

## Key Improvements:

### Responsive Design:
```css
/* Font sizes now scale with viewport */
.main-title {
  font-size: clamp(36px, 5vw, 64px) !important;
}

/* Grids stack on mobile */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container-grid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr !important;
  }
}
```

### Better Content Fit:
- Stats cards have reduced padding
- Practice slides have 90% max-width
- Content wrappers have proper padding
- Visual metaphors resize on mobile

### Fullscreen Experience:
- Clean presentation mode without distractions
- Smooth transitions between slides
- Keyboard shortcuts work reliably
- State syncs with browser fullscreen API

## Testing the Changes:

1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/course/postpartum-wellness-foundations/week/1/lesson/1
2. Try the slides in both normal and fullscreen modes
3. Test on different screen sizes
4. Use keyboard navigation (F, arrows, spacebar, ESC)

The slides should now:
- Fit properly within their containers
- Scale appropriately on different devices
- Provide a smooth fullscreen presentation experience
- Allow scrolling for content that exceeds viewport height
