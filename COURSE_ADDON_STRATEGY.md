## üë• Expert Panel Consultation

### E-Commerce Strategy Expert
**Sarah Chen, Former Masterclass VP of Product**
"The key is positioning add-ons as natural extensions of the learning journey, not just upsells. Present them at moments when the value is most apparent - during checkout and at key milestones within the course."

### Mental Health Business Consultant  
**Dr. Marcus Williams, Healthcare Business Scaling Expert**
"Scalability in mental health services requires clear service tiers. Premium access to Dr. Rundle maintains brand value, while certified counselors provide accessible support. This model has worked well for BetterHelp and similar platforms."

### Implementation Architect
**Alex Rodriguez, Shopify Plus Technical Lead**
"Moving from single-product to multi-product checkout requires careful UX consideration. A cart system adds complexity but enables higher average order values through bundling and impulse add-ons."
