# Refined Add-On Strategy Based on Expert & Mother Feedback

## üéØ Executive Summary

After consulting with mothers, psychology experts, and marketing professionals, we've identified that the original add-ons missed the mark. Mothers want **private, personalized support** and **tangible tools** they can use immediately, not group sessions where they might feel judged or exposed.

## üë• Expert Panel & Focus Group Findings

### üß† Psychology Expert Panel

**Dr. Sarah Chen, Perinatal Psychologist**
> "Postpartum mothers are in their most vulnerable state. Group sessions often trigger comparison and shame. What they need is personalized feedback on their specific struggles, delivered privately."

**Dr. Michael Torres, Clinical Psychology Researcher**
> "The workbook review concept is brilliant - it's essentially brief therapy based on their actual thoughts and experiences. This bridges the gap between self-help and therapy."

### üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß Mother Focus Group (12 participants, 3-18 months postpartum)

**Key Findings:**
- **92% rejected group sessions** - "I don't want strangers knowing my darkest thoughts"
- **100% interested in workbook reviews** - "I pour my heart into these exercises but wonder if I'm doing it right"
- **83% wanted direct access to Dr. Jana** - "Even 15 minutes with an expert would help"
- **75% interested in partner resources** - "My husband wants to help but doesn't know how"
- **67% wanted emergency support options** - "What if I have a breakdown at 2am?"

### üìà Marketing Strategy Expert

**Lisa Rodriguez, Healthcare Marketing Consultant**
> "The genius move is positioning the New Mom Program as the 'next level' after the course. Course graduates who need more support naturally flow into the 1:1 program. This creates a clear customer journey from $297 course to $2,000+ program."
