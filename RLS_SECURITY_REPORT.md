# Supabase RLS Security Report

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES FOUND

Your Supabase database has **20 critical security errors** related to Row Level Security (RLS). These issues expose your data to unauthorized access.

## Summary of Issues

### 1. **Tables with Policies but RLS Disabled (8 tables)**
These are the most critical - you've defined security policies but they're NOT being enforced because RLS is disabled!

- `analytics_events`
- `blog_posts`
- `career_applications`
- `contact_submissions`
- `courses`
- `email_queue`
- `email_templates`
- `subscribers`

**Risk**: Anyone can bypass your security policies and access/modify these tables directly.

### 2. **Tables with No RLS and No Policies (12 tables)**
These tables have zero protection - anyone with your Supabase URL can read/write them!

- `click_heatmap` - Analytics data exposed
- `user_course_access` - User course enrollments exposed
- `course_purchases` - Purchase history exposed
- `admin_sessions` - Admin session data exposed!
- `email_templates_history` - Email history exposed
- `email_automation_errors` - Error logs exposed
- `system_settings` - System configuration exposed!
- `achievements` - User achievements exposed
- `sequence_enrollments` - Email sequences exposed
- `sequence_email_sends` - Email send logs exposed
- `reminder_rules` - User reminders exposed
- `profiles_backup_2025_01_06` - Backup data exposed

### 3. **SECURITY DEFINER View**
- `heatmap_aggregated` - This view bypasses RLS of underlying tables

## Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Enable RLS on Tables with Existing Policies (URGENT)
Run this SQL immediately in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.analytics_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.blog_posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.career_applications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.contact_submissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.courses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.email_queue ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.email_templates ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.subscribers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Step 2: Run Full Security Fix Migration
I've created a comprehensive migration script at `scripts/fix-rls-security.sql` that:
1. Enables RLS on all tables
2. Adds appropriate policies for unprotected tables
3. Ensures service-role-only access for sensitive tables

To apply:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `scripts/fix-rls-security.sql`
3. Run the entire script

### Step 3: Verify Security
After running the migration, verify all tables have RLS enabled:

```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND rowsecurity = false;
```

This query should return NO ROWS.

## Why This Matters

Without RLS enabled:
- **Anyone with your Supabase URL can read ALL data** in unprotected tables
- **Anyone can modify/delete data** in these tables
- Your **admin sessions**, **system settings**, and **user data** are exposed
- You're violating **data privacy regulations** (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Set up monitoring** - Alert when new tables are created without RLS
2. **Review all policies** - Ensure they match your security requirements
3. **Remove backup tables** - Move `profiles_backup_2025_01_06` to a secure location
4. **Audit SECURITY DEFINER views** - Review if `heatmap_aggregated` needs this permission
5. **Enable RLS by default** - Make it a requirement for all new tables

## Testing After Fix

1. Try accessing tables from client-side without authentication
2. Verify authenticated users can only see their own data
3. Test admin access still works properly
4. Ensure service endpoints still function

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues after enabling RLS:
1. Check your API routes are using service role key where appropriate
2. Verify your RLS policies match your access patterns
3. Test incrementally - enable RLS on one table at a time if needed

Remember: **Security is not optional** - these fixes should be applied immediately to protect your users' data.
