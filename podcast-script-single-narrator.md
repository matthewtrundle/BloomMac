# Bloom Psychology Podcast: When Tragedy Strikes - A Parent's Guide
## Single Narrator Version for AI Avatar

---

I want to share something that happened to me last week. My daughter came home from her friend's house and asked me about Camp Mystic. If you're a parent, you probably felt that same punch to the gut I did. I just... froze.

Like so many of us, I found myself scrambling for the right words while managing my own overwhelming worry. And that's exactly why we need to talk about this today.

[PAUSE]

Welcome to a special episode of the Bloom Psychology Podcast. I'm your host from Bloom Psychology, and today we're addressing something that's been weighing heavily on parents' hearts - how to talk to our children about the tragic flooding at Camp Mystic.

I've spent the past week consulting with Dr. Rachel Williams, a child psychologist who specializes in trauma and family communication, and I want to share what I've learned about navigating these impossibly difficult conversations.

## The Parent's Dilemma

Here's what happened to me - and maybe to you too. My first instinct was to protect my daughter from this completely. Shield her. Pretend it didn't happen. But she already knew something terrible had occurred. Her friends were talking about it at school, sharing what they'd heard, and I realized something crucial: she didn't need me to hide reality from her. She needed me to help her understand it.

Dr. Williams explained to me that children are incredibly perceptive. When we avoid difficult topics, they don't just forget about them. Instead, they fill in the blanks with their imagination - and often, what they imagine is far scarier than reality.

I'll be honest - my own imagination was already running wild. I kept thinking about those parents, those children... and trying not to spiral while my daughter stood there, waiting for answers.

## Starting Simple: The Framework

So where do we even begin? Dr. Williams taught me that the key is matching our explanation to our child's developmental level. 

For younger children - let's say ages 4 to 7 - we need to stick to very simple facts. Something like: "There was a big storm that made the river rise very fast. Some people at a camp got hurt, and helpers came to take care of them."

That's it. Brief, factual, but not overwhelming.

For older children - maybe 8 to 12 - they can handle slightly more information: "Heavy rains caused flooding at a summer camp. Emergency teams saved many people, but some were hurt or died."

One thing Dr. Williams emphasized that really stuck with me was mentioning the helpers. Fred Rogers famously said to "look for the helpers" in scary situations. It gives children a sense that even in tragedy, there are people working to make things better.

My son threw me a curveball when he asked why God let this happen. I had no prepared answer for that one. But Dr. Williams reassured me that it's okay to say "I don't know why bad things happen sometimes, but I know we can help each other get through them." We're not expected to have all the answers - and that's actually okay.

## Recognizing Their Emotions

Something unexpected happened with my daughter. She seemed almost... guilty. Like she felt bad for being safe when other kids weren't. She kept asking, "What if that was my camp?"

Dr. Williams calls this survivor's guilt, and apparently it can affect children just as much as adults. The key is acknowledging these feelings without dismissing them. I learned to say: "It's normal to feel upset when bad things happen to other people. It shows you have a caring heart."

I love that reframing - "a caring heart." It turns something painful into something positive.

But then there's fear. My youngest won't even talk about going to her day camp now. Fear is a protective emotion, but we don't want it to limit our children's lives. This is where concrete reassurance helps. 

I actually pulled up our camp's emergency procedures and looked at them together with my daughter. We talked about how our camp is different, what safety measures exist, and how rare these events really are. Giving her that sense of control and understanding seemed to help tremendously.

## The Parent's Journey

Can I be really honest with you for a moment? I've been a mess about this. I found myself doom-scrolling at 2 AM, refreshing news sites, reading every update. Each new piece of information just ramped up my anxiety more.

But here's what Dr. Williams helped me understand: we can't pour from an empty cup. If we're anxious and overwhelmed, our children will pick up on that energy. They're like little emotional barometers.

So what do we do? We can't just ignore what happened. 

It's about finding balance. I've started setting specific times to check news - once in the morning, once in the evening. That's it. And when I feel that urge to grab my phone and scroll, I make tea instead. Just that five-minute ritual of boiling water, steeping tea, holding the warm cup - it helps reset my nervous system.

Another technique that's helped me is the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise. Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. It brings you right back to the present moment when your mind starts spiraling.

And yes, I'll admit it - I've had a good cry or two in the shower. Emotions need to move through us. The key is having that release away from our children if they're not ready to see us that vulnerable.

## Practical Tools for Processing

So let's get really practical. What specific things can we do with our kids to help them process this?

Creative expression is incredibly powerful. Drawing pictures, writing stories, even playing with toys to act out rescue scenarios - it all helps children process without having to find perfect words. My daughter decided to write cards for the families affected. It seemed to really help her feel less helpless. 

Dr. Williams reminded me that action is the antidote to anxiety. Even small gestures matter.

But when should we worry? When is it more than just normal processing?

Watch for persistent changes - nightmares lasting more than a week or two, refusing normal activities, regressing in behaviors like bedwetting, or obsessively talking about the event. Those are signs it's time to reach out for professional support.

And let me be clear: there's absolutely no shame in getting help. We take our children to the doctor for physical ailments - their emotional health deserves the same level of care.

## Finding Meaning and Moving Forward

As I've worked through this with my own children, I keep wondering - how do we help them find meaning in something so senseless?

Dr. Williams taught me that we focus on what we can control. How we respond. How we help. How we care for each other. Tragedy can teach us about resilience and community.

My daughter surprised me yesterday. She asked if we could donate some of her summer camp supplies to kids who might need them. It was entirely her idea. Children often show us the way forward. They have this incredible capacity for hope and healing when we give them the right support.

[PAUSE]

I know this has been a heavy topic, but I hope sharing my journey through this - the mistakes, the learning, the small victories - helps you navigate these waters with your own children.

Remember, you don't have to be perfect. Being present and honest is enough. 

If you need additional support, we have resources in our show notes, including how to connect with child therapists in your area. And remember, at Bloom Psychology, we're here for your family's journey - especially through the tough moments.

Take care of yourself, so you can take care of them. And remember - we're all in this together.

Until next time, from all of us at Bloom Psychology, take care of each other.
