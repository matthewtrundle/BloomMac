### Legacy Templates (DEPRECATED) ⚠️

- Basic HTML without styling or personalization
- No emoji usage
- Simple text-based content

## Where Templates Are Used

✅ **API Endpoints** (`/pages/api/email-automation.ts`)
- Uses enhanced templates exclusively
- Has backward compatibility mapping for old numeric steps

✅ **Test Email System** (`/pages/api/test-email.ts`)
- Defaults to enhanced templates
- Legacy options available but marked deprecated

✅ **Admin Interface** (`/app/admin/email-test/page.tsx`)
- Lists all enhanced templates with emojis first
- Legacy templates clearly marked as deprecated

✅ **Email Automation** (`/lib/email-automation.ts`)
- Processes enhanced templates through the system
- Personalizes content with subscriber data

## Recommendation

**Continue using the enhanced templates.** They are:
- Already integrated and working perfectly
- Much more engaging and professional
- On-brand with Bloom's aesthetic
- Psychologically optimized for conversion
- Getting positive engagement (5 emails sent today)

## No Action Needed

The system is already using your wife's enhanced templates as the primary email system. The legacy templates are only kept for backward compatibility and are clearly marked as deprecated throughout the system.

Your wife's work on these templates has created a cohesive, professional email experience that aligns perfectly with Bloom Psychology's brand and values. The templates include thoughtful touches like:
- Warm, empathetic language
- Strategic CTAs
- Social proof elements
- Time-sensitive offers
- Beautiful visual design

The enhanced templates are a significant upgrade and are already delivering value to your email automation system.
