# Performance Optimization Summary - Bloom Psychology North Austin

## Overview
This document outlines all the steps taken during the performance optimization attempt and the issues encountered.

## Initial Situation
- **Lighthouse Score**: ~66 (Mobile)
- **LCP**: 3.7s
- **TBT**: 750ms
- **Bundle Size**: ~160KB
- **React Version**: 19.1.0 (initially)
- **Next.js Version**: 15.3.1

## Optimization Steps Attempted

### Phase 1: Next.js Configuration Optimizations
1. **Updated next.config.ts**:
   ```typescript
   // Added image optimization formats
   images: { 
     formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
     deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
     imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
   }
   
   // Enabled SWC minify
   swcMinify: true
   
   // Added browser caching headers
   headers: async () => [
     {
       source: '/(.*)',
       headers: [
         { key: 'Cache-Control', value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable' }
       ]
     }
   ]
   
   // Added bundle analyzer
   const withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
     enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
   })
   ```

2. **Modified app/layout.tsx**:
   - Added hero image preload link tag
   - Attempted to add critical CSS but this caused issues

### Phase 2: Component Optimizations
1. **Attempted to remove unnecessary "use client" directives**
   - This caused errors with React hooks and state management
   - Framer-motion components required client-side rendering

2. **Tried to implement dynamic imports**:
   - Attempted to lazy load heavy components
   - This conflicted with framer-motion SSR requirements

### Phase 3: Bundle Optimization
1. **Added package dependencies**:
   - @next/bundle-analyzer
   - cross-env (for environment variables)

2. **Created analysis script**:
   ```json
   "analyze": "cross-env ANALYZE=true next build"
   ```

## Errors Encountered

### Major Error: "Element type is invalid"
This error occurred after optimization attempts and persisted throughout debugging:
```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
```

### Root Cause Discovery
1. **React 19 + Framer-motion Incompatibility**
   - React 19.1.0 was incompatible with framer-motion 12.9.4
   - Framer-motion requires React 18 or earlier

2. **Authentication Error**
   ```
   TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'auth' of 'e' as it is undefined
   ```
   - This error appeared during builds but the source was unclear

## Recovery Steps Taken

### 1. React Downgrade
- Downgraded from React 19.1.0 to React 18.3.1
- Updated both react and react-dom packages
- Fixed TypeScript types to match React 18

### 2. Framer-motion Removal
Due to persistent issues, removed framer-motion entirely:
- Removed all motion.div components
- Replaced with standard HTML elements
- Removed animation variants and props
- Simplified components to static versions

### 3. Component Fixes
- Fixed image source references (service.image → service.heroImage)
- Fixed link references (service.link → `/services/${service.slug}`)
- Fixed font class references (font-script → font-playfair italic)

### 4. Clean Installation
- Removed node_modules and .next directories
- Performed fresh npm install
- Ensured all dependencies aligned properly

## Current State
- Site builds successfully without errors
- All animations removed (trade-off for stability)
- React 18.3.1 running stably
- Bundle size and performance metrics need re-evaluation

## Files Modified
1. `/app/page.tsx` - Simplified, removed client-side features
2. `/components/layout/ConsultLauncher.tsx` - Removed framer-motion
3. `/components/ui/*.tsx` - Multiple UI components simplified
4. `/next.config.ts` - Added optimization configurations
5. `/package.json` - Updated dependencies

## Lessons Learned
1. React 19 has compatibility issues with many animation libraries
2. Aggressive optimization can break working features
3. Always check library compatibility before major version upgrades
4. Incremental optimization is safer than wholesale changes
5. Maintain backups/git commits before major optimizations

## Next Steps
1. Re-measure performance metrics with current stable build
2. Implement safer optimizations one at a time:
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Font optimization
   - Critical CSS
3. Consider alternative animation libraries compatible with React 18
4. Test each optimization thoroughly before proceeding

## Performance Optimizations Still Valid
These optimizations from the original plan can still be safely implemented:
- Image format optimization (WebP/AVIF)
- Font loading optimization
- ISR for blog posts
- Resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch)
- Bundle size analysis and reduction
