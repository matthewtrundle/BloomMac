2. **Resource Download** → Lead nurture series (4 emails over 14 days)
3. **Appointment Reminder** → 24-hour and 2-hour reminders

### ⚠️ Disabled/Incomplete Triggers:

2. **Booking Confirmation** → Initial confirmation email has TODO, only reminders work
3. **User Registration** → Creates account but doesn't trigger welcome email

## 🎯 Recommendations

### 1. **Clean Up Legacy Templates**
- **Action**: Delete "Welcome to Bloom Psychology" from database (replaced by enhanced version)
- **Reason**: Outdated, no styling, confusing duplicate

### 2. **Activate Contact Form Emails**
- **Action**: Uncomment email trigger in `/app/api/contact/submit/route.ts`
- **Reason**: Valuable touchpoint for potential clients

### 3. **Complete Booking Confirmation Flow**
- **Action**: Implement booking confirmation email in `/app/api/appointments/book/route.ts`
- **Reason**: Professional expectation, reduces no-shows

### 4. **Consider Manual Campaign Templates**
- **Keep**: "5 Ways to Manage Daily Anxiety" and "New Mom Support Program"
- **Use Case**: Manual newsletters or targeted campaigns

### 5. **Add Missing Sequences**
- **User Registration Welcome**: New users should get welcome email
- **Appointment Cancellation**: Acknowledge cancellations professionally
- **Re-engagement Campaign**: For inactive subscribers after 60-90 days

### 6. **Documentation Improvements**
- Create visual flowchart of all email triggers
- Document which sequences are active/inactive
- Add testing instructions for each sequence
