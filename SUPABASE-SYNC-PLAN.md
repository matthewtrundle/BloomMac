# Supabase Database Synchronization Plan

## Current Situation
- **Local Supabase**: Running at http://127.0.0.1:54321
- **Production Supabase**: Your live database with actual schema
- **Issue**: Migration files don't match actual database structure

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Pull Production Schema (RECOMMENDED)
This ensures we're working with your actual database structure.

```bash
# 1. Link to your production project
supabase link --project-ref [YOUR-PROJECT-REF]

# 2. Pull the production database schema
supabase db pull

# 3. This creates migration files matching your production schema
# Check what was created
ls supabase/migrations/
```

### Option 2: Inspect Production Schema Directly
If you have the Supabase dashboard access:

1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run this query to see all tables:
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

4. For each table, check its structure:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';
```

### Option 3: Generate RLS from Existing Schema
Once we know your actual tables:

```bash
# 1. Create a script to read current schema
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres \
  -c "\dt public.*" > current-tables.txt

# 2. Generate appropriate RLS policies based on actual tables
```

## Next Steps

1. **Tell me your Supabase project reference** (looks like: `abcdefghijklmnop`)
   - You can find this in your Supabase dashboard URL
   - Or in your project settings

2. **Or share your production schema**:
   - Export from Supabase dashboard: Settings → Database → Backups
   - Or run the SQL query above and share the table list

3. **Then we'll create proper migrations** that:
   - Match your actual database structure
   - Add RLS policies to the correct tables
   - Won't fail with "table does not exist" errors

## Why This Matters

- **Local Dev**: Your local Supabase might not have all tables from production
- **Migrations**: Should match production schema exactly
- **RLS Policies**: Need to reference actual table names

## Questions to Answer:

1. Do you have your Supabase project reference?
2. Can you access the Supabase dashboard SQL editor?
3. Do you want to pull the production schema locally?
4. Are there any tables you DON'T want RLS on?

Let's get your actual schema first, then create migrations that will work!
