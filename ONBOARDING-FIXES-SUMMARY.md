# Onboarding Flow Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ "No user found in session" Error
**Problem**: ProfileStep was using `useUser()` from wrong import
**Solution**: Changed to use `useAuth()` hook from AuthContext
**Status**: FIXED

### 2. ✅ Missing API Endpoints
**Problem**: Several endpoints were called but didn't exist
**Solutions Created**:
- `/api/analytics/track` - Created to handle analytics events
- `/api/achievements` - Created to handle achievement awards
**Status**: FIXED

### 3. ✅ Wrong Newsletter Endpoint
**Problem**: AccessStep was calling `/api/newsletter/subscribe` (didn't exist)
**Solution**: Changed to use `/api/newsletter-signup`
**Status**: FIXED

### 4. ✅ Duplicate Information Collection
**Problem**: Signup asked for name/email, then ProfileStep asked again
**Solutions**:
- ProfileStep now extracts names from user metadata
- Added visual indicators showing data is pre-filled
- Terms acceptance from signup is carried forward
**Status**: FIXED

### 5. ✅ Poor Error Messages
**Problem**: Generic "Something went wrong" without details
**Solutions**:
- Added detailed error messages for each validation
- Added step information to error display
- Added console logging for debugging
- Created ErrorBoundary component
**Status**: FIXED

## Current Onboarding Flow

1. **Signup Page** (`/auth/signup`)
   - Collects: Full Name, Email, Password
   - User accepts Terms of Service

2. **Profile Step** 
   - Pre-fills: First Name, Last Name (from signup)
   - Collects: Phone (optional), Emergency Contact (optional), Maternal Health Info (optional)

3. **Consent Step**
   - Shows: Terms already accepted (from signup)
   - Requires: HIPAA consent
   - Optional: Marketing consent

4. **Access Step**
   - Choose: Course, Workshop, or Waitlist
   - If waitlist: Adds to newsletter subscribers

5. **Complete Step**
   - Awards: Welcome achievement
   - Redirects: To dashboard

## Testing

Run these commands to test:
```bash
# Quick file and setup check
node scripts/quick-onboarding-check.js

# API endpoint test (requires dev server)
npm run dev  # In one terminal
npm run test:onboarding  # In another

# Full browser test (requires Playwright)
npm install --save-dev playwright
npm run test:onboarding:browser
```

## If Issues Still Occur

1. **Check Browser Console** - The actual error will be logged
2. **Check Network Tab** - Look for failed API calls
3. **Check Auth State** - User might not be authenticated
4. **Clear Browser Storage** - Sometimes stale sessions cause issues

## Database Requirements

Ensure these Supabase tables exist:
- `auth.users` (built-in)
- `public.user_profiles`
- `public.subscribers`
- `public.user_course_access`

## Environment Variables Required

In `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
