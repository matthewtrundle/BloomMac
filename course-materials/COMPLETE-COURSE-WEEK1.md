# LESSON 1: WELCOME TO YOUR FOURTH TRIMESTER
*Duration: 10 minutes | Slides: 15*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:00] Opening - Creating Sacred Space
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana in warm, welcoming setting]

"Hello, beautiful mama. I'm Dr. Jana, and before we begin, I want you to take a moment to honor yourself. You are here, investing in your mental health during one of life's most challenging transitions. That isn't just courage - that's profound wisdom.

[PAUSE for emphasis]

What you're experiencing right now - the overwhelm, the uncertainty, maybe even the numbness - it's not a flaw in your character. It's your nervous system responding to the most significant biological and psychological transformation a human can experience.

[Hand on heart gesture]

So welcome to this sacred space we're creating together. This isn't just a course - it's your sanctuary."

### [1:00-2:30] Container Setting - Psychological Safety
[VISUAL: Beautiful slide with container boundaries]

"Before we dive deep, let's establish our therapeutic container - the boundaries that keep this space safe:

This space IS:
- Trauma-informed and attachment-focused
- Based on 15+ years of clinical research
- A place where ALL parts of you are welcomed
- Designed for your nervous system's current capacity
- Your permission slip to prioritize yourself

This space is NOT:
- A substitute for crisis intervention or medical care
- A place for toxic positivity or 'just think positive'
- Somewhere you need to perform or be 'grateful enough'

[EMOTIONAL CHECKPOINT]
Take three deep breaths with me. Notice: What does your body need right now? Permission to cry? To rest? To feel seen? You have it."

### [2:30-4:30] The Fourth Trimester - Reframing the Narrative
[VISUAL: Powerful timeline with transformation imagery]

"Society tells us the fourth trimester is 'just' the first three months. But neuroscience tells us a different story. Your brain is literally rewiring itself - growing new neural pathways for vigilance, empathy, and connection.

[VISUAL: Brain scan comparisons]

Look at this: These are brain scans showing maternal brain changes. Your gray matter is reorganizing. Your amygdala (fear center) is hyperactive - not because you're anxious, but because you're evolutionarily designed to protect your young.

You're not broken. You're BECOMING.

Simultaneously, you're experiencing:
- The largest hormonal shift in human biology
- Identity death and rebirth (matrescence)
- Attachment reorganization with everyone in your life
- Physical recovery from what's essentially an endurance event
- Sleep deprivation that would be considered torture in other contexts

[VALIDATION MOMENT]
When you think about it this way - that you're navigating ALL of this while keeping a vulnerable human alive - your resilience is actually extraordinary."

### [4:30-6:00] Statistics - You're Not Alone (Reframed)
[VISUAL: Community of faces, diverse representation]

"Let me share some numbers, but not as statistics - as your invisible community:

- 80% of mothers experience baby blues - that's 4 out of every 5 moms you see at Target
- 20% develop postpartum depression - that's your neighbor, your sister, your friend
- 15% experience postpartum anxiety - including high-achieving, 'together' women
- 40% report intrusive thoughts - and most are too ashamed to tell anyone

[REVOLUTIONARY REFRAME]
But here's what those numbers really tell us: Struggling is NORMAL. It's not a bug in the system - it's a feature. Your psyche is doing exactly what it's supposed to do when faced with monumental change.

The problem isn't you. The problem is a culture that expects you to 'bounce back' from an experience that's meant to fundamentally change you."

### [6:00-7:30] Your Fourth Trimester Rights - Revolutionary Self-Care
[VISUAL: Elegant, screenshot-worthy slide]

"These aren't just nice ideas - they're therapeutic prescriptions for your healing:

You have the RIGHT to:
- Feel whatever you feel without justification
- Ask for help as many times as you need it
- Prioritize your mental health as much as baby's physical health
- Grieve who you were before becoming a mother
- Change your mind about parenting choices
- Have needs that exist beyond your baby's needs
- Define successful motherhood on YOUR terms
- Take up space, be imperfect, and still be worthy of love

[EMBODIMENT MOMENT]
As I read each one, notice which ones your body resists. That's where your healing work begins."

### [7:30-9:00] This Week's Transformational Practice
[VISUAL: Gentle hands on heart imagery]

"Your assignment this week isn't homework - it's medicine:

The 'Enough' Practice:
3 times daily, place both hands on your heart and say:
'I am learning, and that's enough.
I am trying, and that's enough.
I am here, and that's enough.'

[GUIDED PRACTICE]
Let's do this together right now. Hands on heart...

[PAUSE - actually practice together]

Notice what comes up. Resistance? Tears? Relief? All welcome.

This isn't positive thinking. This is nervous system regulation. Your touch releases oxytocin. Your voice speaking kindness rewires your internal dialogue.

This is neuroscience-backed self-compassion."

### [9:00-10:00] Bridge to Next Lesson
[VISUAL: Soft transition]

"In our next lesson, we'll explore what's happening in your body during recovery. Not the sanitized version you got at your six-week checkup, but the real, nuanced truth that helps you understand why healing takes time.

Remember: This is YOUR journey. You can pause, rewind, cry, or celebrate. All of it is part of your becoming.

See you soon, brave one."

# LESSON 2: YOUR BODY'S WISDOM - RECOVERY REIMAGINED
*Duration: 12 minutes | Slides: 18*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:00] Opening - Honoring Your Body
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana, warm and grounded]

"Welcome back, warrior. Today we're having the conversation about postpartum recovery that you deserved to have before you gave birth - but probably didn't get.

We're going to talk about bleeding, sweating, leaking, pain, and yes, that first terrifying postpartum bowel movement. But more than that, we're going to talk about your body's incredible wisdom.

[REFRAME]
Everything you're experiencing - the discomfort, the strangeness, the not-feeling-like-yourself - isn't your body failing. It's your body succeeding at one of the most complex biological processes imaginable."

### [1:00-3:00] The First 6 Weeks - Minute by Minute Honesty
[VISUAL: Beautiful, non-medical timeline]

"Let's talk about what's REALLY happening:

Weeks 1-2: The Immediate Aftermath
- Lochia (bleeding) - your uterus shedding its pregnancy lining, like the world's longest period
- Night sweats that soak your sheets - your body releasing 40+ pounds of extra fluid
- Afterpains during nursing - your uterus contracting back to size
- Perineal/incision pain - your tissues healing from trauma
- Breast engorgement - your body learning to calibrate milk production
- Emotional lability - hormones dropping faster than a roller coaster

Weeks 3-4: The Fog
- Continued bleeding (normal until 6-8 weeks)
- Bone-deep fatigue that sleep doesn't fix
- Hair starting to shed (you'll find it everywhere)
- 'Mom brain' - actually your brain conserving energy for survival tasks
- Everything feeling surreal

Weeks 5-6: False Finish Line
- Bleeding usually stopping
- Energy tiny bit better
- Pressure to 'be back to normal'
- Reality: You're maybe 30% recovered

[TRUTH BOMB]
The '6-week clearance' is about infection risk, not full healing. Your body needs 12-18 months to fully recover."

### [3:00-5:00] The Hidden Recovery - What They Don't Tell You
[VISUAL: Iceberg metaphor - surface vs. deep healing]

"Here's what continues for months:

Months 2-6:
- Core and pelvic floor rebuilding (literal reconstruction)
- Hormonal fluctuations (especially if breastfeeding)
- Hair loss peak (month 3-4) - completely normal
- Sleep debt accumulation affecting everything
- Joint laxity from relaxin hormone
- Emotional integration of birth experience

Months 6-12:
- Gradual energy return
- New body equilibrium
- Hormonal stabilization
- Hair regrowth
- Relationship to body evolving

[PERMISSION SLIP]
Your body isn't broken or slow. It's doing exactly what it needs to do. Healing happens in layers, not timelines."

### [5:00-7:00] Warning Signs - When to Get Help
[VISUAL: Clear, non-alarming but important info]

"Your intuition is your best guide, but here are clear signs to call your provider:

Immediate (call now):
- Heavy bleeding (pad per hour for 2+ hours)
- Fever over 100.4°F
- Severe headache with vision changes
- Difficulty breathing
- Thoughts of harm to self or baby
- Severe abdominal pain

Soon (within 24 hours):
- Foul-smelling discharge
- Red streaks from breast
- Unable to urinate
- Severe mood changes
- Any gut feeling that something's wrong

[EMPOWERMENT]
You know your body better than anyone. Trust yourself. Healthcare providers WANT you to call."

### [7:00-9:30] Supporting Your Recovery - The R.E.S.T. Method
[VISUAL: Each letter beautifully illustrated]

"R - RADICAL REST
Not just sleep (though that too). Rest from:
- Decision-making when possible
- Social obligations
- Productivity pressure
- Comparison to others

E - EASEFUL NOURISHMENT
- Warm, cooked foods that digest easily
- Hydration like it's your job
- Someone else doing the cooking when possible
- Nutritional supplements as recommended

S - SLOW MOVEMENT
Your body craves gentle motion:
- Walking at YOUR pace
- Pelvic floor breathing
- Gentle stretching
- Dancing if it brings you joy

T - THERAPEUTIC TOUCH
- Warm baths/showers
- Massage (professional or partner)
- Skin-to-skin with baby
- Self-massage with oils

[ASSIGNMENT]
Choose ONE element from R.E.S.T. to prioritize this week."

### [9:30-11:00] Your Body's Love Letter
[VISUAL: Beautiful, emotional slide]

"If your body could write you a letter, it might say:

'Dear Beautiful Human,
I carried life. I opened to let life through. I am feeding life with my own substance. I am recovering from the most intense physical experience possible while functioning on minimal sleep.

I am not the same as I was before, and I was never meant to be.

I am softer in some places, stronger in others. I have stretch marks that are actually strength marks. I have a tender belly that housed a miracle.

I need time. I need gentleness. I need you to see my changes as transformation, not damage.

I am not broken. I am becoming.
With love and admiration,
Your Amazing Body'"

### [11:00-12:00] Integration & Next Steps
[VISUAL: Gentle closing]

"Today's practice: Write your body a thank you note. Just one sentence. Put it where you'll see it.

Next lesson: We dive into the emotional landscape of this transition. Because your feelings are just as valid and important as your physical healing.

Remember: Your body is not your enemy. It's your greatest ally in this journey."

# LESSON 3: EMOTIONAL ALCHEMY - TRANSFORMING DIFFICULT FEELINGS
*Duration: 14 minutes | Slides: 20*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - Permission to Feel Everything
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana, holding space with presence]

"Hello, brave heart. If you cried yesterday, you're in perfect company. If you felt rage, confusion, or numbness - also perfect company. If you felt joy and guilt about feeling joy - you belong here too.

Today we're diving into the emotional ocean of early motherhood. Not to fix your feelings, but to understand them as messengers of your psyche's wisdom.

[FOUNDATIONAL TRUTH]
In my 15 years as a perinatal psychologist, I've learned this: There are no wrong feelings in the fourth trimester. There are only feelings that have been judged as wrong by a culture that doesn't understand transformation.

Every emotion you're experiencing is either:
1. A normal response to extraordinary change, or
2. Information about what you need

Today, we become emotion scientists together."

### [1:30-3:30] The Neuroscience of Motherhood - Your Changing Brain
[VISUAL: Beautiful brain imagery, not clinical]

"Let's start with what's happening in your brain:

[VISUAL: Brain regions highlighted]

The Maternal Brain Transformation:
- Amygdala (fear center): 20% larger, hypervigilant
- Prefrontal cortex: Temporarily reduced (hence 'mom brain')
- Insula: Enhanced for reading baby's cues
- Dopamine pathways: Rewiring for attachment

[REVOLUTIONARY INSIGHT]
Your anxiety? It's your amygdala doing its job.
Your forgetfulness? Your brain prioritizing survival tasks.
Your emotional intensity? Your nervous system calibrating to protect your young.

You're not losing your mind. You're gaining a mother's mind.

[HORMONAL REALITY]
Simultaneously, you're experiencing:
- Estrogen and progesterone: Dropped 90% (imagine going off antidepressants overnight)
- Prolactin: Surging (affects mood and anxiety)
- Oxytocin: Fluctuating (bonding and contractions)
- Cortisol: Often elevated (stress response)

This isn't a design flaw. This is evolution ensuring survival. Your emotional intensity is FUNCTIONAL."

### [3:30-5:30] The Feeling Spectrum - Normalizing the 'Abnormal'
[VISUAL: Beautiful emotion wheel, inclusive and expansive]

"Let's name what you might be feeling - not to pathologize, but to normalize:

LOVE & TERROR (simultaneously):
- Fierce love that feels overwhelming
- Fear something will happen to baby
- Protective rage at the world

GRIEF & JOY (coexisting):
- Mourning your previous life
- Celebrating your baby
- Missing who you were
- Discovering who you're becoming

RAGE & GUILT (cycling):
- Anger at lack of support
- Rage at your partner's freedom
- Guilt about feeling angry
- Resentment about sacrifice

NUMBNESS & OVERWHELM (alternating):
- Feeling nothing despite 'should' feeling everything
- Emotional flooding from hormones
- Dissociation as protection

[VALIDATION]
If you're feeling ALL of these in one day - or one hour - you're not unstable. You're human experiencing the most complex emotional transition possible."

### [5:30-7:30] The Hidden Feelings - Breaking the Silence
[VISUAL: Safe, warm environment for difficult truths]

"Now for the feelings no one talks about:

REGRET:
'Sometimes I wish I hadn't had a baby'
'I want my old life back'
'I don't know if I'm cut out for this'

RESENTMENT:
'Everyone else's life stayed the same'
'My partner doesn't understand'
'I feel like I've lost myself'

FEAR OF NOT LOVING ENOUGH:
'I don't feel the instant bond I expected'
'What if I'm not a natural mother?'
'Am I damaging my baby by feeling this way?'

INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS:
'What if I drop the baby?'
'What if I hurt my baby?'
'What if something terrible happens?'

[CLINICAL WISDOM]
These thoughts occur in 40-80% of new mothers. They're not predictions. They're your hypervigilant brain checking for dangers.

Having these thoughts doesn't make you a bad mother. It makes you a mother whose brain is working overtime to protect your child.

[WHEN TO WORRY]
Seek help if thoughts become:
- Persistent and distressing
- Accompanied by urges to act
- Preventing you from caring for baby
- Making you avoid being alone with baby"

### [7:30-9:30] The P.A.U.S.E. Method - Emotional Regulation
[VISUAL: Each step beautifully illustrated]

"When emotions feel overwhelming, use P.A.U.S.E.:

P - PAUSE & NOTICE
'I notice I'm feeling...' (Name it specifically)
'I notice this in my body...' (Where do you feel it?)
'I notice my thoughts are...' (Racing? Catastrophizing?)

A - ACKNOWLEDGE & VALIDATE
'Of course I'm feeling this - look at what I'm navigating'
'This feeling makes sense given..'
'All parts of me are welcome here'

U - UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE
'What is this feeling trying to tell me?'
'What do I need right now?'
'How can I honor this feeling without being overwhelmed by it?'

S - SOOTHE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM
- Box breathing (4-4-4-4)
- Cold water on wrists
- Humming or singing
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Call a supportive person

E - ENGAGE WISE ACTION
'What's one tiny step I can take right now?'
'Who can I reach out to?'
'What boundary do I need to set?'

[PRACTICE MOMENT]
Let's try this with whatever you're feeling right now..."

### [9:30-11:30] Daily Emotional Alchemy Practices
[VISUAL: Practical, beautiful tools]

"Your Daily Emotional Care Menu (choose 2-3):

MORNING ATTUNEMENT (2 minutes):
- Hand on heart, three breaths
- 'What am I feeling right now?'
- 'What do I need today?'

EMOTION NAMING (throughout day):
- Every strong feeling: 'I'm noticing anxiety'
- No judgment, just observation
- Track patterns in your phone

BEDTIME RELEASE (5 minutes):
- What feelings am I carrying that aren't mine?
- What do I need to let go of from today?
- Write it down or speak it aloud

WEEKLY EMOTIONAL INVENTORY:
- What patterns am I noticing?
- Which feelings need more attention?
- What support do I need?

[REVOLUTIONARY REFRAME]
You're not managing emotions - you're alchemizing them. Turning difficult feelings into wisdom, isolation into connection, confusion into clarity."

### [11:30-13:00] Creating Your Emotional Support Network
[VISUAL: Interconnected web of support]

"Map your emotional support team:

IMMEDIATE COMFORT (for crisis moments):
- Who can you call at 2am?
- Who listens without giving advice?
- Who can sit with you in the dark?

PRACTICAL SUPPORT (for daily overwhelm):
- Who can bring food?
- Who can hold baby while you shower?
- Who can help with household tasks?

PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT (for deeper healing):
- Therapist specializing in perinatal mental health
- Support groups (virtual or in-person)
- Psychiatric care if needed

JOY PARTNERS (for reconnection):
- Who makes you laugh?
- Who helps you remember who you are beyond 'mom'?
- Who celebrates your wins?

[ACTION STEP]
Write down one name in each category. Even if you're not ready to reach out, having the list reduces panic."

### [13:00-14:00] Integration & Blessing
[VISUAL: Peaceful, loving energy]

"This week's practice: The Feeling Weather Report

Each evening, ask yourself:
'What was the weather in my emotional world today?'
Stormy? Sunny? Foggy? Mixed conditions?

No judgment. Just meteorology of the heart.

[BLESSING]
Your feelings are not too much. They're not wrong. They're not a problem to be solved.

They're the language of your soul navigating the most profound transformation of your life.

Next lesson: We begin rebuilding - creating sustainable joy and meaning in your new life.

Until then, be gentle with your precious heart."

# LESSON 4: BUILDING YOUR FOUNDATION - THE FOUR PILLARS OF THRIVING
*Duration: 11 minutes | Slides: 16*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:00] Opening - From Surviving to Designing
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana, grounded and hopeful]

"Welcome to our final lesson of Week 1, beautiful human. We've explored your physical reality, emotional landscape, and now we're moving from understanding to designing.

You've been in survival mode - and rightfully so. But starting today, we begin building something sustainable. Not a perfect life, but a supported one. Not a life without struggle, but one with resources for resilience.

Today we architect your foundation for thriving."

### [1:00-3:00] The Four Pillars Framework - Holistic Wellness
[VISUAL: Beautiful architectural metaphor]

"Your postpartum wellness rests on four interconnected pillars:

PILLAR 1: SOMATIC WELLNESS (Your Body-Mind)
- Physical recovery and energy management
- Nervous system regulation
- Embodied self-care practices
- Medical and therapeutic support

PILLAR 2: EMOTIONAL WELLNESS (Your Inner World)
- Feeling processing and integration
- Self-compassion practices
- Joy cultivation and meaning-making
- Professional mental health support

PILLAR 3: RELATIONAL WELLNESS (Your Connections)
- Partnership dynamics and communication
- Family system navigation
- Friendship and community building
- Boundaries and reciprocity

PILLAR 4: SYSTEMIC WELLNESS (Your Environment)
- Practical support systems
- Financial security and planning
- Household management
- Childcare and backup plans

[SYSTEMS THINKING]
When one pillar is weak, the others compensate - but become overloaded. Our goal is steady, sustainable support across all four."

### [3:00-5:00] Pillar Assessment - Where You Are Now
[VISUAL: Interactive, self-compassionate assessment]

"Let's honestly assess each pillar (1-10 scale):

SOMATIC WELLNESS:
- How supported is your physical recovery?
- How regulated is your nervous system?
- How sustainable is your energy management?

EMOTIONAL WELLNESS:
- How well are you processing feelings?
- How kind is your inner dialogue?
- How connected are you to joy and meaning?

RELATIONAL WELLNESS:
- How supported do you feel in your relationships?
- How clear are your boundaries?
- How much reciprocity exists in your connections?

SYSTEMIC WELLNESS:
- How much practical support do you have?
- How secure do you feel about logistics?
- How manageable is your daily life?

[WISDOM]
Most new mothers score low across multiple pillars. This isn't failure - it's information. We're not aiming for 10s. We're aiming for enough support to breathe and grow."

### [5:00-7:00] Minimum Viable Wellness (MVW) Plan
[VISUAL: Simple, achievable daily structure]

"Let's create your Minimum Viable Wellness Plan - the absolute basics for daily functioning:

DAILY NON-NEGOTIABLES (Choose 3):
□ Hydration tracking (water bottle always with you)
□ One nourishing meal (even if someone else makes it)
□ 10 minutes outside (even if just sitting on porch)
□ One supportive interaction (text counts)
□ Basic hygiene (shower OR face wash)
□ Three conscious breaths when triggered
□ One self-compassion phrase
□ Ask for one specific help

WEEKLY ESSENTIALS (Choose 2):
□ One longer rest period
□ One joy activity (even 15 minutes)
□ One administrative task completed
□ One relationship tending conversation
□ One boundary set or honored

[SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLE]
This isn't about optimization. It's about creating minimum conditions for your nervous system to stay regulated and your soul to stay connected."

### [7:00-9:00] Building Your Support Ecosystem
[VISUAL: Interconnected web of care]

"Create your comprehensive support map:

IMMEDIATE SUPPORT (for today's needs):
- Who can you text right now if overwhelmed?
- Who can come over within 2 hours if needed?
- Who can take baby for 30 minutes so you can rest?

ONGOING SUPPORT (for weekly needs):
- Who can help with groceries/meals?
- Who can provide regular emotional check-ins?
- What services can you hire/ask for help with?

PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT (for specialized needs):
- Primary care provider
- OB/GYN or midwife
- Pediatrician
- Mental health therapist
- Lactation consultant (if breastfeeding)
- Pelvic floor physical therapist

CRISIS SUPPORT (for emergency needs):
- Mental health crisis line
- Postpartum Support International
- Emergency medical care
- Trusted person who can take baby immediately

[ACTION STEP]
Fill in at least one name/resource in each category. Having the map reduces panic when needs arise."

### [9:00-10:00] Week 1 Integration Ritual
[VISUAL: Peaceful, ceremonial feeling]

"Let's close Week 1 with intention:

YOUR WEEK 1 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
✓ You showed up for learning
✓ You gained language for your experience
✓ You created initial support maps
✓ You practiced self-compassion
✓ You're building awareness

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
- What's one insight that shifted something for you?
- What's one practice you want to continue?
- What's one support you're ready to reach for?

SETTING INTENTIONS FOR WEEK 2:
'Next week, I will focus on...'
'I give myself permission to...'
'I commit to practicing...'"

### [10:00-11:00] Bridge to Week 2 & Closing Blessing
[VISUAL: Hopeful, forward-looking]

"Next week, we dive deeper into working with difficult thoughts and creating cognitive flexibility. We'll learn tools from CBT and ACT to help you relate differently to worry, self-criticism, and catastrophic thinking.

But for now, rest in what you've accomplished. You've built the foundation. Everything else is building upon this solid base.

[CLOSING BLESSING]
May you be gentle with yourself this week.
May you reach for support when you need it.
May you remember that healing isn't linear.
And may you trust that you're exactly where you need to be.

See you next week, warrior. You're doing beautifully."
