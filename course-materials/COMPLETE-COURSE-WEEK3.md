## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - From Survival to Thriving
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana, energized but compassionate presence]

"Welcome to Week 3, beautiful soul. If you've made it this far, you've done the deep work of understanding your body and befriending your mind. Now we turn toward rebuilding vitality and joy.

I know what some of you are thinking: 'Joy? I can barely survive each day.' And that's exactly why we're here.

[FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH]
You don't wait to feel better to start doing better. You start doing better to feel better. This isn't about forcing positivity - it's about understanding the profound connection between what you do and how you feel.

[CLINICAL INSIGHT]
In treating postpartum depression for over 15 years, I've learned: Mood follows action more than action follows mood. Today we harness this wisdom."

### [1:30-3:30] The Activity-Mood Connection
[VISUAL: Beautiful circular diagram showing activity-mood cycle]

"Here's what happens in postpartum depletion:

THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL:
Depleted mood â†’ Less activity â†’ More isolation â†’ Lower mood â†’ Even less activity

Why this happens:
- Sleep deprivation reduces motivation
- Hormonal changes affect reward system
- Social isolation increases depression
- Loss of previous activities creates grief
- Overwhelming responsibilities crowd out joy

[NEUROSCIENCE INSIGHT]
Your brain's reward system (dopamine pathways) needs activation to function well. When you stop doing rewarding activities, these pathways weaken. Your brain literally forgets how to experience pleasure.

THE UPWARD SPIRAL:
Small positive action â†’ Tiny mood lift â†’ Slightly more energy â†’ Ability for more action â†’ Better mood

[HOPE MESSAGE]
This isn't about dramatic life changes. It's about micro-activations that rebuild your capacity for vitality.

The goal isn't constant happiness - it's restoring your full emotional range, including the ability to experience pleasure, accomplishment, and connection."

### [3:30-5:30] Types of Nourishing Activities
[VISUAL: Beautiful categories with examples]

"Activities that rebuild vitality fall into four categories:

1. PLEASURE ACTIVITIES (Feed Your Soul)
- Sensory pleasures: Warm bath, good coffee, soft music
- Creative expression: Drawing, singing, crafting
- Nature connection: Sunlight, fresh air, plants
- Physical pleasure: Gentle movement, stretching, massage

2. ACCOMPLISHMENT ACTIVITIES (Build Confidence)
- Completing tasks: Organizing one drawer, answering emails
- Learning: Reading, podcasts, online courses
- Creating: Cooking, writing, making something
- Problem-solving: Fixing something, planning ahead

3. CONNECTION ACTIVITIES (Combat Isolation)
- Intimate sharing: Deep conversation with friend
- Community participation: Mom groups, classes, volunteering
- Family connection: Quality time with partner/children
- Professional connection: Networking, mentoring

4. MEANING ACTIVITIES (Feed Your Purpose)
- Values-based actions: Acting according to your principles
- Service: Helping others, contributing to causes
- Growth: Personal development, spiritual practice
- Legacy building: Creating something lasting

[KEY INSIGHT]
You need activities from ALL four categories for balanced wellbeing. Most exhausted moms focus only on accomplishment, neglecting pleasure, connection, and meaning."

### [5:30-7:30] Identifying Your Current Activity Pattern
[VISUAL: Gentle self-assessment visualization]

"Let's honestly assess your current activity levels:

PLEASURE ACTIVITIES:
- When did you last do something purely for enjoyment?
- What small pleasures have you abandoned since becoming a mom?
- What used to bring you joy that feels impossible now?

ACCOMPLISHMENT ACTIVITIES:
- Beyond baby care, what gives you a sense of achievement?
- What skills or interests have you neglected?
- What small wins could you celebrate?

CONNECTION ACTIVITIES:
- How often do you have meaningful conversations?
- When did you last feel truly seen and understood?
- What relationships need attention?

MEANING ACTIVITIES:
- What matters most to you beyond daily survival?
- How are you living according to your values?
- What legacy do you want to create?

[COMPASSIONATE REALITY CHECK]
If you're struggling to answer these questions, that's information, not judgment. Early motherhood often involves temporary contraction of activities. This is normal and survivable.

[ASSESSMENT INSIGHT]
Most new moms are:
- Low on pleasure (survival mode)
- Medium on accomplishment (but only baby-related)
- Low on connection (isolation common)
- Very low on meaning (no bandwidth for bigger picture)

Knowing where you are helps you know where to focus."

### [7:30-9:30] Barriers to Activation and Gentle Solutions
[VISUAL: Barriers with compassionate solutions]

"Common barriers and realistic solutions:

BARRIER: 'I don't have time'
SOLUTION: Start with 5-minute activities
- 5-minute dance session
- 5-minute call to a friend
- 5-minute creative activity
- 5-minute nature observation

BARRIER: 'I don't have energy'
SOLUTION: Choose low-energy, high-reward activities
- Listening to favorite music
- Looking at beautiful images
- Gentle stretching
- Texting a supportive friend

BARRIER: 'I feel guilty doing things for myself'
SOLUTION: Reframe self-care as family care
- 'My wellbeing benefits my family'
- 'I'm modeling self-care for my children'
- 'I can give more when my cup isn't empty'

BARRIER: 'Nothing sounds appealing'
SOLUTION: Start with previously enjoyed activities
- Do them whether you feel like it or not
- Start smaller than feels necessary
- Trust that enjoyment may return gradually

BARRIER: 'I should be focused on my baby'
SOLUTION: Include baby when possible
- Dance with baby
- Nature walks with stroller
- FaceTime friends while baby plays
- Creative activities during baby's awake time

[WISDOM]
You don't need to feel motivated to take action. Action creates motivation, not the other way around."

### [9:30-10:30] Starting Your Activation Practice
[VISUAL: Gentle beginning steps]

"This week's gentle activation plan:

DAY 1-2: AWARENESS
- Simply notice what activities you do beyond baby care
- Track your mood throughout the day (1-10 scale)
- Note any correlation between activities and mood

DAY 3-4: TINY EXPERIMENTS
- Choose ONE 5-minute pleasure activity daily
- Choose ONE small accomplishment activity
- Notice any shifts in mood or energy

DAY 5-7: GRADUAL EXPANSION
- Add ONE connection activity
- Add ONE meaning-based activity
- Continue tracking mood and activities

[STARTING POINTS]
Choose activities that feel 60% doable, not 100% exciting. We're rebuilding capacity, not forcing enthusiasm.

Examples:
- Put on favorite song while feeding baby
- Send one appreciative text to a friend
- Organize one small space
- Step outside for three deep breaths

[COMMITMENT]
What ONE tiny activity will you commit to trying this week?"

### [10:30-11:00] Integration & Next Steps
[VISUAL: Path forward with small steps]

"Remember: You're not trying to return to your pre-baby activity level. You're creating a new, sustainable rhythm that honors both your motherhood and your personhood.

Next lesson: We dive deeper into rediscovering and cultivating joy in your current life.

[ENCOURAGEMENT]
Every small action is a vote for the life you want to create. You're not just surviving anymore - you're beginning to thrive.

Your future self will thank you for every tiny step you take today."

# LESSON 2: REDISCOVERING JOY IN MOTHERHOOD
*Duration: 13 minutes | Slides: 18*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - Joy as Revolution
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana with warm, conspiratorial energy]

"Welcome back, joy seeker. Today we're talking about something that might feel impossible right now: finding joy in your current life.

Not the Instagram version of joy. Not the 'grateful mama' performance. Real joy - the kind that bubbles up from deep inside when you least expect it.

[REVOLUTIONARY INSIGHT]
In a culture that expects mothers to sacrifice everything for their children, choosing joy is an act of revolution. It's saying: 'My happiness matters. My vitality serves my family.'

[CLINICAL WISDOM]
Joy isn't a luxury in early motherhood - it's medicine. It's what prevents depression from taking root and what helps you show up as the mother you want to be.

Today we reclaim your birthright to feel good."

### [1:30-3:30] Understanding Joy vs. Happiness
[VISUAL: Comparison diagram with examples]

"Let's distinguish between happiness and joy:

HAPPINESS:
- Dependent on circumstances
- Temporary and fleeting
- Based on external events
- Often elusive during difficult times

JOY:
- Available regardless of circumstances
- Arises from connection and meaning
- Based on internal recognition
- Accessible even during challenges

EXAMPLES OF JOY IN MOTHERHOOD:
- The weight of your sleeping baby on your chest
- Watching your baby discover their hands
- The smell of your baby's head
- Your baby's first smile directed at you
- The quiet moments of successful soothing
- Your own strength in meeting challenges
- The love that surprises you with its intensity

[JOY BLOCKERS IN EARLY MOTHERHOOD]
- Exhaustion masking beautiful moments
- Anxiety overshadowing present experiences
- Comparison stealing gratitude
- Overwhelm crowding out awareness
- Perfectionism preventing presence

[INSIGHT]
Joy is always available - but you need to train your attention to notice it."

### [3:30-6:00] The Neuroscience of Joy and Gratitude
[VISUAL: Brain imagery showing joy pathways]

"Here's what happens in your brain when you experience joy:

NEUROCHEMICAL CHANGES:
- Dopamine release: Motivation and reward
- Serotonin increase: Mood stability and wellbeing
- Oxytocin surge: Connection and bonding
- Endorphin production: Natural pain relief and pleasure

NEURAL PATHWAY STRENGTHENING:
- Joy experiences create neural pathways
- Repeated joy practices strengthen these pathways
- Your brain literally learns to notice more joy
- Attention training rewires automatic responses

[GRATITUDE'S POWER]
Gratitude practices specifically:
- Increase left prefrontal cortex activity (positive emotions)
- Reduce amygdala reactivity (fear response)
- Strengthen neural pathways for optimism
- Improve immune function and sleep quality

THE JOY-RESILIENCE CONNECTION:
- Joy experiences build emotional reserves
- Positive emotions broaden perspective
- Pleasant memories become resources during hard times
- Joy practices increase stress tolerance

[PRACTICAL IMPLICATION]
Even 30 seconds of intentional joy noticing changes your brain. This isn't wishful thinking - it's neuroscience."

### [6:00-8:30] Micro-Moments of Joy Practice
[VISUAL: Beautiful examples of tiny joyful moments]

"Joy doesn't require dramatic experiences. It lives in micro-moments:

SENSORY JOY:
- The first sip of warm coffee
- Sunlight on your skin
- Your baby's soft skin against yours
- The sound of rain on windows
- Fresh air filling your lungs

CONNECTION JOY:
- Eye contact with your baby
- A hug that lasts three seconds longer
- A friend's laugh on the phone
- Your partner bringing you tea
- A stranger's smile at the grocery store

ACCOMPLISHMENT JOY:
- Baby successfully napping
- A task completed
- A problem solved creatively
- A moment of successful soothing
- Progress noticed

SPIRITUAL JOY:
- Feeling connected to something larger
- Moments of awe and wonder
- Gratitude that takes your breath away
- Sensing your baby's pure essence
- Recognizing your own growth

THE 3-BREATH JOY PRACTICE:
1. Notice a pleasant moment
2. Take three conscious breaths
3. Say internally: 'This is joy'

[ASSIGNMENT]
Catch 3 micro-moments of joy today. Don't create them - just notice them."

### [8:30-10:30] Joy Scheduling and Planning
[VISUAL: Gentle calendar with joy activities]

"Intentional joy scheduling for exhausted moms:

DAILY JOY ANCHORS (choose 2):
- Morning: One thing to look forward to
- Midday: One moment of presence
- Evening: One gratitude reflection

WEEKLY JOY INFUSIONS (choose 1):
- Solo: 30 minutes doing something purely for pleasure
- Social: Connection with someone who lights you up
- Creative: Making or creating something
- Nature: Time outdoors with intention

MONTHLY JOY INVESTMENTS (plan ahead):
- Larger experience that feeds your soul
- Time with people who truly see you
- Activity that connects you to your pre-mom identity
- Something you've been wanting to try

JOY EMERGENCY KIT (for hard days):
- List of 10 things that always bring you tiny joy
- Photos that make you smile
- Songs that lift your spirits
- Sensory items (essential oils, soft textures)
- Contacts of people who can boost your mood

[SUSTAINABLE JOY PRINCIPLES]
- Start smaller than you think necessary
- Include baby when possible
- Don't wait for perfect circumstances
- Lower the bar for what counts as joy
- Celebrate noticing joy, even if you don't feel it fully

[PLANNING EXERCISE]
Look at this week and identify:
- 3 daily moments you could infuse with more joy
- 1 weekly activity you could add
- 1 person you could connect with
- 1 creative/pleasurable activity to try"

### [10:30-12:00] Overcoming Joy Resistance
[VISUAL: Gentle exploration of resistance]

"Common resistance to joy and loving responses:

RESISTANCE: 'I don't deserve joy when I'm struggling'
RESPONSE: 'Joy is medicine for struggle, not a reward for perfection'

RESISTANCE: 'Focusing on joy feels selfish'
RESPONSE: 'My joy creates a more positive environment for my family'

RESISTANCE: 'I should be focused on my responsibilities'
RESPONSE: 'Joy gives me energy to meet my responsibilities more fully'

RESISTANCE: 'I don't have time for joy'
RESPONSE: 'Joy can be found in moments I'm already living'

RESISTANCE: 'Nothing feels joyful anymore'
RESPONSE: 'Practicing joy attention rebuilds my capacity to feel it'

RESISTANCE: 'I feel guilty being happy when my baby is fussy'
RESPONSE: 'My emotional regulation helps me respond to baby more skillfully'

[DEEPER RESISTANCE WORK]
If joy feels completely foreign:
- Start with contentment or peace instead
- Notice moments of 'not-bad' before expecting 'good'
- Practice appreciation before gratitude
- Look for beauty before seeking happiness

[GENTLE INQUIRY]
What messages did you learn about joy, pleasure, or happiness growing up? How might these be affecting your current relationship with joy?

Compassionate reframe: You learning to experience joy is gift to everyone who loves you."

### [12:00-13:00] Integration and Joy Commitment
[VISUAL: Commitment ceremony feeling]

"This week's joy practices:

â–¡ Daily 3-breath joy noticing practice
â–¡ Weekly joy planning and scheduling
â–¡ Joy resistance awareness and gentle response
â–¡ Micro-moment appreciation throughout days
â–¡ Emergency joy kit creation

[JOY AFFIRMATIONS]
Choose one that resonates:
- 'I am worthy of joy in all seasons of my life'
- 'My joy contributes to my family's wellbeing'
- 'I can find beauty and pleasure in small moments'
- 'Joy is my birthright, not something I have to earn'

[COMMITMENT RITUAL]
Place your hand on your heart and make this commitment:
'I commit to noticing joy in my life. I commit to believing I deserve happiness. I commit to seeking and creating moments of pleasure and beauty, knowing this serves not just me, but everyone I love.'

Next lesson: We explore creating meaningful activities that align with your deepest values.

Remember: Joy is not frivolous. Joy is fuel."

# LESSON 3: VALUES-BASED LIVING AND MEANINGFUL ACTIVITIES
*Duration: 14 minutes | Slides: 19*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - From Survival to Values
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana with grounded, purposeful energy]

"Welcome back, meaning-maker. We've talked about joy and pleasure - now we go deeper into what makes life feel worthwhile.

In early motherhood, it's easy to lose touch with what matters most to you beyond keeping everyone alive. Your world shrinks to feeding schedules and diaper changes. This isn't wrong - it's necessary survival.

But there comes a time when you need to remember: Who are you? What do you stand for? How do you want to live?

[CLINICAL INSIGHT]
Mothers who maintain connection to their core values during the transition show greater resilience, less depression, and more life satisfaction long-term.

[INVITATION]
Today we reconnect with your authentic self and begin living from your deepest truths, even within the constraints of early motherhood."

### [1:30-3:30] Understanding Core Values

### [3:30-6:00] Values Assessment for New Mothers
[VISUAL: Gentle assessment tool]

"Let's identify your core values in this season:

VALUES CLARIFICATION EXERCISE:

1. LIFE REVIEW METHOD
Think of moments when you felt most alive and authentic:
- What were you doing?
- What values were you living?
- What made these moments meaningful?

2. ENERGY AUDIT METHOD
Consider activities that:
- Give you energy vs. drain you
- Feel aligned vs. feel forced
- Create satisfaction vs. create resentment
What values are present in energizing activities?

3. ADMIRATION METHOD
Think of mothers you admire:
- What qualities do they embody?
- How do they live their values?
- What values do you see reflected in their choices?

4. REGRET ANALYSIS METHOD
Consider moments of regret or disappointment:
- What values were you unable to honor?
- What would living your values have looked like?
- How can you align more closely going forward?

[MOTHERHOOD VALUES EXPLORATION]
How have your values shifted since becoming a mother?
- What values have become MORE important?

- What values feel impossible to live right now?

[COMMON MOTHERHOOD VALUE SHIFTS]
- Safety and protection become paramount
- Connection and family move to center
- Achievement and recognition may decrease
- Present moment awareness increases
- Service and nurturing expand
- Independence and freedom get redefined

This isn't loss - it's evolution."

### [6:00-8:30] Living Values in Small Ways
[VISUAL: Micro-actions aligned with values]

"You don't need dramatic life changes to live your values:

IF YOU VALUE CONNECTION:
- Send one meaningful text daily
- Make eye contact during baby care
- Share one vulnerable truth with your partner
- Call a friend while walking with stroller
- Join one mom group or online community

IF YOU VALUE CREATIVITY:
- Take one photo that captures beauty
- Hum or sing while doing baby care
- Rearrange one space aesthetically
- Try one new recipe or combination
- Write three sentences about your experience

IF YOU VALUE LEARNING:
- Listen to podcasts during feeding
- Read one article about something interesting
- Ask one question you've been curious about
- Watch one educational video
- Learn one new thing about child development

IF YOU VALUE HEALTH:

- Support another mother
- Contribute to a cause you care about
- Share helpful information
- Model values for your children

[MICRO-VALUES PRACTICE]
Values can be lived in 30-second moments. It's not about grand gestures - it's about conscious choices throughout your day."

### [8:30-11:00] Creating Your Values-Based Activity Plan
[VISUAL: Planning template with values integration]

"Let's create sustainable ways to honor your values:

STEP 1: IDENTIFY YOUR TOP 5 VALUES
From our exploration, what are your most important values right now?

STEP 2: ASSESS CURRENT ALIGNMENT
For each value, rate 1-10:
- How well am I currently living this value?
- What obstacles prevent me from living this value?
- What small changes could increase alignment?

STEP 3: DESIGN MICRO-PRACTICES
For each value, create:
- One daily micro-action (30 seconds - 5 minutes)
- One weekly practice (15-30 minutes)
- One monthly experience (larger time investment)

STEP 4: INTEGRATE WITH EXISTING LIFE
How can you infuse values into:
- Baby care routines
- Household tasks
- Self-care activities
- Relationships
- Rest and leisure

STEP 5: CREATE VALUES REMINDERS
- Phone wallpaper with your values
- Sticky notes with value words
- Daily intention setting
- Weekly values check-in

[EXAMPLE VALUES INTEGRATION]
Value: CREATIVITY
- Daily: Take one beautiful photo
- Weekly: Try one creative cooking experiment
- Monthly: Visit a museum or gallery
- Integration: Sing to baby, arrange flowers, wear colors you love

[REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS]
You won't live all values perfectly all the time. The goal is conscious awareness and small, consistent choices."

### [11:00-12:30] Values-Based Decision Making
[VISUAL: Decision-making framework]

"Use your values as a compass for daily decisions:

THE VALUES FILTER:
When facing choices, ask:
- Which option better aligns with my values?
- How can I honor my values within constraints?
- What would living my values look like here?
- How can I be true to myself in this situation?

EXAMPLE DECISIONS:

SOCIAL INVITATION:
Value: Connection vs. Rest
Values-based response: 'I value both connection and rest. Could we do something low-key that honors both?'

PARTNER CONFLICT:
Value: Honesty vs. Harmony
Values-based response: 'I value our relationship and my own truth. How can I share honestly while staying connected?'

BABY CARE CHOICE:
Value: Attachment vs. Independence
Values-based response: 'How can I respond to my baby's needs while also taking care of myself?'

[VALUES-BASED BOUNDARIES]
Your values help you set healthy boundaries:
- 'I value family time, so I won't check work emails after 7pm'
- 'I value my health, so I need help with night feeds'
- 'I value honesty, so I'll share when I'm struggling'

[DECISION-MAKING PRACTICE]
Think of one current decision you're facing. Apply the values filter. What guidance emerges?"

### [12:30-14:00] Living Your Values Legacy
[VISUAL: Future-oriented, legacy imagery]

"Your values-based living creates ripple effects:

FOR YOUR CHILDREN:
- They learn what matters by watching you
- They see how to live authentically
- They understand that mothers are whole people
- They witness values-based decision making

FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIPS:
- People know what you stand for
- You attract aligned connections
- You contribute authentically
- You model healthy living

FOR YOURSELF:
- You maintain connection to your identity
- You experience meaning beyond survival
- You build resilience through purpose
- You create a life you're proud of

[LEGACY REFLECTION]
Imagine your child as an adult, describing how you lived during their early years:
- What values would you want them to say you embodied?
- How would you want them to remember your choices?
- What legacy do you want to create through your daily living?

[VALUES COMMITMENT]
This week's practices:
â–¡ Daily values awareness and micro-actions
â–¡ Weekly values check-in and course correction
â–¡ Monthly values-based planning
â–¡ Decision-making through values filter
â–¡ Legacy consciousness in daily choices

[CLOSING AFFIRMATION]
'I honor my values in small and large ways. I live authentically while adapting to motherhood. My values guide me toward a meaningful life.'

Next lesson: We integrate everything into sustainable habits for long-term vitality.

Remember: Living your values isn't selfish - it's the greatest gift you can give your family."

# LESSON 4: SUSTAINABLE HABITS FOR ONGOING VITALITY
*Duration: 12 minutes | Slides: 17*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - From Inspiration to Integration
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana with grounded, sustainable energy]

"Welcome to our final Week 3 lesson, habit architect. We've explored behavioral activation, rediscovered joy, and reconnected with values. Now we make it sustainable.

The difference between transformation and inspiration is daily practice. Anyone can feel motivated for a week. The mothers who thrive long-term are those who build systems that support their wellbeing automatically.

[SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLE]
We're not creating a perfect life - we're creating a sustainable life. One that can weather sick days, growth spurts, teething, and all the beautiful chaos of raising humans.

[INTEGRATION GOAL]
By the end of today, you'll have a realistic, flexible system for maintaining vitality that grows with you as your children grow."

### [1:30-3:30] Understanding Habit Formation for Exhausted Moms
[VISUAL: Gentle habit loop illustration]

"Traditional habit advice doesn't work for new mothers:

TRADITIONAL ADVICE: '21 days makes a habit'
MOM REALITY: Some days you can't even remember what day it is

TRADITIONAL ADVICE: 'Start with big changes'
MOM REALITY: You have 30 seconds of mental energy

TRADITIONAL ADVICE: 'Be consistent every day'
MOM REALITY: Every day is different with babies

MOM-FRIENDLY HABIT PRINCIPLES:

1. MICRO-HABITS RULE
- Start smaller than feels meaningful
- Make it impossible to fail
- Build consistency before intensity

2. FLEXIBILITY IS KEY
- Plan for interruptions
- Create multiple versions (2-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute)
- Focus on frequency, not perfection

3. STACK WITH EXISTING ROUTINES
- Attach new habits to established behaviors
- Use baby's schedule as anchors
- Leverage transition moments

4. SELF-COMPASSION IS NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Expect interruptions and restarts
- Celebrate any effort
- Focus on progress, not perfection

[HABIT FORMATION SCIENCE FOR MOMS]
Your sleep-deprived brain needs:
- Extra simplicity
- Clear environmental cues
- Immediate rewards
- Flexible implementation

We're working with your brain, not against it."

### [6:00-8:30] Creating Your Personal Vitality Routine
[VISUAL: Customizable routine template]

"Design your sustainable vitality routine:

MORNING VITALITY SEQUENCE (5-10 minutes):
- Before baby wakes or while baby feeds
- 1 energy practice + 1 intention setting
- Examples:
  * 3 breaths + gratitude thought
  * Gentle stretches + values intention
  * Favorite music + joy noticing

MIDDAY RESET (2-5 minutes):
- During baby's nap or independent play
- 1 restoration practice + 1 connection
- Examples:
  * Quick walk + text to friend
  * Drink tea mindfully + check-in with body
  * Creative moment + appreciate baby

EVENING INTEGRATION (5-10 minutes):
- After baby's bedtime or before your sleep
- 1 reflection practice + 1 preparation for tomorrow
- Examples:
  * Gratitude journaling + intention for tomorrow
  * Partner check-in + self-appreciation
  * Beauty moment + values reflection

WEEKLY VITALITY PLANNING (10-15 minutes):
- Sunday evening or whenever feels right
- Review week + plan ahead
- Adjust routines based on what worked

[CUSTOMIZATION QUESTIONS]
- What time of day do you have most energy?
- What existing routines could you attach habits to?
- What activities consistently make you feel better?
- What obstacles typically derail your self-care?
- How can you design around those obstacles?

[ROUTINE FLEXIBILITY]
Create three versions:
- Crisis mode (30 seconds each)
- Normal mode (2-5 minutes each)
- Expansion mode (10+ minutes each)

Use whichever version fits your current capacity."

### [8:30-10:30] Habit Troubleshooting and Maintenance
[VISUAL: Problem-solving flowchart]

"Common habit challenges and solutions:

CHALLENGE: 'I keep forgetting'
SOLUTIONS:
- Set phone reminders
- Use visual cues (sticky notes)
- Stack with baby care routines

âœ“ You've reconnected with sources of joy
âœ“ You've clarified your core values

[INTEGRATION RITUAL]
Take a moment to appreciate how far you've come:
- From surviving to beginning to thrive
- From depleted to seeking vitality
- From disconnected to values-aligned
- From reactive to intentional

[FUTURE VISIONING]
Imagine yourself 6 months from now, living this vitality routine:
- How do you start your days?
- How do you navigate challenges?
- How do you connect with joy and meaning?
- How do you model wellbeing for your family?

This isn't fantasy - this is your emerging reality.

[COMMITMENT TO VITALITY]
Place your hand on your heart and make this commitment:
'I commit to honoring my vitality. I commit to small, consistent actions that support my wellbeing. I commit to believing that my flourishing serves everyone I love.'

[BRIDGE TO WEEK 4]
Next week we focus on managing anxiety and worry - learning to calm your nervous system and find peace amidst the chaos.

But for now, celebrate this: You're not just surviving motherhood. You're learning to thrive within it.

Your vitality is a gift to the world."
