### [0:00-1:30] Opening - Normalizing Anxiety in Motherhood
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana with calm, understanding presence]

"Welcome to Week 4, anxious warrior. If you're watching this while feeling worried about something - about your baby, your abilities, your future - you're in exactly the right place.

Anxiety in early motherhood isn't a character flaw. It's not weakness. It's not evidence that you're not cut out for this.

[FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH]
Anxiety is love with nowhere to go. It's your nervous system working overtime to protect what matters most to you.

[CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE]
Postpartum anxiety affects up to 20% of new mothers - more than postpartum depression. Yet it's often dismissed as 'normal worry' or overlooked entirely.

Today we distinguish between helpful caution and problematic anxiety, and learn to work with your nervous system instead of against it."

### [1:30-3:30] The Spectrum of Postpartum Anxiety
[VISUAL: Gentle spectrum showing normal worry to clinical anxiety]

"Let's understand the anxiety spectrum:

NORMAL NEW PARENT WORRY:
- Checking if baby is breathing occasionally
- Concerns about feeding and growth
- Wondering if you're doing things right
- Worry that motivates helpful action
- Manageable and doesn't interfere with daily life

HEIGHTENED BUT MANAGEABLE ANXIETY:
- More frequent checking on baby
- Difficulty relaxing when baby sleeps
- Overthinking decisions about baby care
- Some avoidance of situations that feel risky
- Responds to reassurance and self-care

PROBLEMATIC ANXIETY:
- Constant worry that interferes with functioning
- Repetitive checking that doesn't provide relief
- Avoiding normal activities due to fear
- Physical symptoms (racing heart, trouble breathing)
- Intrusive thoughts about harm coming to baby
- Difficulty sleeping even when baby sleeps
- Feeling like you can't turn your mind off

[NORMALIZATION]
Most new mothers experience some level of heightened anxiety. Your brain is literally designed to be more vigilant right now.

[WHEN TO SEEK HELP]
If anxiety is:
- Interfering with sleep or eating
- Preventing you from leaving the house
- Making it hard to enjoy your baby
- Causing physical symptoms
- Feeling uncontrollable

Remember: Seeking help is strength, not failure."

### [3:30-5:30] The Neuroscience of Maternal Anxiety
[VISUAL: Beautiful brain imagery showing anxiety pathways]

"Your anxious brain is actually functioning exactly as designed:

NEUROBIOLOGICAL CHANGES:
- Amygdala (fear center): 20% larger during postpartum period
- Stress response system: More sensitive to threats
- Vigilance networks: Hyperactive for baby protection
- Sleep centers: Disrupted, increasing overall anxiety

HORMONAL INFLUENCES:
- Dropping estrogen: Affects mood stability
- Fluctuating progesterone: Impacts sleep and calm
- Elevated cortisol: Keeps you in alert state
- Oxytocin surges: Intensify protective instincts

EVOLUTIONARY PURPOSE:
This anxiety served our ancestors:
- Detected threats to vulnerable infants
- Motivated protective behaviors
- Ensured infant survival
- Prepared for quick response to danger

[MODERN MISMATCH]
The problem: Your stone-age brain is trying to protect your baby in a modern world full of:
- Information overload
- Conflicting advice
- Social media comparison
- Endless potential "threats" to worry about

[REFRAME]
Your anxiety isn't broken - it's calibrated for a different world. We can work with it, not against it."

### [5:30-7:30] Common Postpartum Anxiety Patterns
[VISUAL: Thought pattern examples with gentle illustration]

"Recognizing common anxiety patterns:

CATASTROPHIC THINKING:
'What if something happens to the baby while I sleep?'
'What if I drop the baby?'
'What if I make the wrong decision and harm my child?'

CONTROL ANXIETY:
'I need to research everything before making any decision'
'I can't let anyone else care for my baby'
'If I'm not constantly vigilant, something bad will happen'

PERFECTIONISM ANXIETY:
'I have to be the perfect mother'
'Any mistake I make will damage my child'
'Other mothers seem to know what they're doing'

HEALTH ANXIETY:
'Every symptom could be something serious'
'Is my baby developing normally?'
'What if I miss important warning signs?'

SOCIAL ANXIETY:
'Everyone can see I don't know what I'm doing'
'I'll be judged for my parenting choices'
'I don't fit in with other mothers'

EXISTENTIAL ANXIETY:
'What kind of world have I brought my child into?'
'Am I equipped to handle this responsibility?'
'Will I ever feel like myself again?'

[VALIDATION]
These thoughts are incredibly common. Having them doesn't make you an anxious person - it makes you a mother whose brain is working overtime to protect your child."

### [7:30-9:30] The Anxiety-Avoidance Cycle
[VISUAL: Cycle diagram showing how avoidance increases anxiety]

"Understanding why anxiety gets worse when we avoid:

THE CYCLE:
1. Anxiety triggers about situation
2. Avoid situation to feel better
3. Short-term relief reinforces avoidance
4. Anxiety grows stronger for next time
5. Avoidance increases, world gets smaller

EXAMPLES IN MOTHERHOOD:

SOCIAL SITUATIONS:
Anxiety: 'What if baby cries at the restaurant?'
Avoidance: Stop going out
Result: Increased isolation and social anxiety

CAREGIVER SUPPORT:
Anxiety: 'What if someone else doesn't do it right?'
Avoidance: Never let others help
Result: Exhaustion and increased control anxiety

NEW EXPERIENCES:
Anxiety: 'What if I can't handle this new situation?'
Avoidance: Stick to familiar routines only
Result: Decreased confidence and increased rigidity

[BREAKING THE CYCLE]
The antidote to anxiety is not avoidance - it's gradual, supported exposure combined with nervous system regulation.

[GENTLE APPROACH]
We don't throw you into the deep end. We start with tiny steps while building your internal resources for calm."

### [9:30-11:00] Anxiety vs. Intuition: Learning to Trust Yourself
[VISUAL: Two paths showing anxiety vs. intuitive guidance]

"Distinguishing between anxiety and maternal intuition:

ANXIETY FEELS LIKE:
- Racing, repetitive thoughts
- Physical tension and urgency
- 'What if' scenarios
- Difficulty finding relief
- Based in future fears
- Increases with reassurance-seeking

INTUITION FEELS LIKE:
- Calm, clear knowing
- Embodied wisdom
- Present-moment awareness
- Actionable guidance
- Based in current information
- Strengthens with quiet attention

EXAMPLE DISTINCTION:
Anxiety: 'What if my baby has something wrong that I'm missing?'
Intuition: 'Something feels different about baby today - I'll call the doctor.'

Anxiety: 'I need to check on baby every 5 minutes'
Intuition: 'Baby seems uncomfortable - let me see what they need.'

[DEVELOPING DISCERNMENT]
- Pause before reacting to anxious thoughts
- Ask: 'Is this fear or wisdom?'
- Notice: Does this thought help or spiral?
- Trust: Your intuition is accessible beneath the anxiety

[TRUSTING YOURSELF]
You know your baby better than anyone. Beneath the anxiety is deep maternal wisdom. We're learning to access it."

### [11:00-12:00] This Week's Foundation Practice
[VISUAL: Grounding and centering imagery]

"Your anxiety management foundation:

DAILY ANXIETY CHECK-INS:
- Morning: 'What am I worried about today?'
- Midday: 'How is my nervous system feeling?'
- Evening: 'What anxieties can I release before sleep?'

THE 3-3-3 GROUNDING TECHNIQUE:
When anxiety spikes:
- Name 3 things you can see
- Name 3 things you can hear
- Move 3 parts of your body

BREATH AWARENESS (not control):
- Simply notice your breathing
- No need to change it
- Let it be exactly as it is
- This builds capacity for regulation

[WEEK 4 INTENTION]
This week, we're not trying to eliminate anxiety. We're learning to dance with it, to understand its messages, and to build your capacity for calm.

Next lesson: We dive into nervous system regulation - the biological foundation of lasting calm.

Remember: Your anxiety is not your enemy. It's information. Today we begin learning its language."

# LESSON 2: NERVOUS SYSTEM REGULATION FOR MOTHERS
*Duration: 13 minutes | Slides: 19*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - Your Internal GPS
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana with grounded, calm energy]

"Welcome back, nervous system explorer. Your nervous system is like your body's GPS - constantly scanning the environment and deciding: 'Am I safe or in danger?'

For new mothers, this GPS is often stuck on 'DANGER AHEAD' even when you're perfectly safe at home with your sleeping baby.

[LIBERATION INSIGHT]
You can't think your way out of a dysregulated nervous system. But you can learn to work with your body's wisdom to find genuine calm.

[TODAY'S GOAL]
We're going to learn practical, science-based techniques to help your nervous system remember: 'I am safe. My baby is safe. I can relax.'

These aren't just coping strategies - they're life skills that will serve you for decades of motherhood."

### [1:30-3:30] Understanding Your Nervous System States
[VISUAL: Beautiful diagram of nervous system states]

"Your autonomic nervous system has three main states:

VENTRAL VAGAL (CALM & CONNECTED):
- Feels like: Peaceful, present, able to connect
- Body signs: Steady breathing, relaxed muscles, warm
- Thinking: Clear, flexible, problem-solving
- Behavior: Responsive, creative, playful

SYMPATHETIC (FIGHT/FLIGHT):
- Feels like: Anxious, agitated, restless
- Body signs: Fast heart rate, shallow breathing, tense
- Thinking: Racing thoughts, worst-case scenarios
- Behavior: Hypervigilant, controlling, reactive

DORSAL VAGAL (FREEZE/SHUTDOWN):
- Feels like: Numb, exhausted, disconnected
- Body signs: Low energy, heavy limbs, flat
- Thinking: Foggy, hopeless, blank
- Behavior: Withdrawn, collapsed, checked out

[NEW MOTHER REALITY]
You might cycle through all three states in one day - or one hour! This is normal when your system is under stress.

[THE GOAL]
We're not aiming for constant calm. We're building flexibility - the ability to move between states and return to regulation more quickly.

[NERVOUS SYSTEM WISDOM]
Your body is always trying to protect you. Sometimes it just needs gentle guidance to remember what safety feels like."

### [3:30-6:00] The Polyvagal Theory for Moms
[VISUAL: Simplified polyvagal hierarchy illustration]

"Dr. Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory explains why traditional 'just relax' advice doesn't work:

YOUR VAGUS NERVE:
- Longest nerve in your body
- Connects brain to heart, lungs, digestive system
- Has two branches: ventral (calm) and dorsal (shutdown)
- Constantly assessing safety vs. threat

NEUROCEPTION:
Your nervous system detects safety/danger below conscious awareness through:
- Facial expressions (yours and others')
- Vocal tones and prosody
- Body postures and movements
- Environmental cues
- Internal bodily sensations

[POSTPARTUM NEUROCEPTION]
Your system is hypervigilant because:
- Sleep deprivation = threat signal
- Hormonal fluctuations = instability signal
- Crying baby = urgency signal
- New responsibilities = overwhelm signal

[SAFETY SIGNALS FOR NEW MOMS]
Your nervous system feels safer when:
- Breathing is slow and deep
- Face and jaw are relaxed
- Voice is warm and melodic
- Body is grounded and supported
- Environment is predictable
- Social connections are warm

[PRACTICAL IMPLICATION]
We regulate your nervous system through your body, not your thoughts. Your body leads, your mind follows."

### [6:00-8:30] Regulation Techniques for Daily Life
[VISUAL: Practical techniques with step-by-step visuals]

"Nervous system regulation tools for real mom life:

TECHNIQUE 1: THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGH
- Double inhale through nose (long inhale, short top-off)
- Long exhale through mouth
- Instantly shifts nervous system toward calm
- Use when: anxiety spikes, baby crying, before difficult conversations

TECHNIQUE 2: VAGAL TONING
- Humming while doing baby care
- Singing lullabies (for you and baby)
- Gargling water
- Chanting 'Om' or any comfortable sound
- Use when: need to stay calm during baby care

TECHNIQUE 3: COLD WATER REGULATION
- Splash cold water on face and wrists
- Hold ice cubes briefly
- Cold drink with mindful attention
- Activates vagus nerve quickly
- Use when: feeling overwhelmed or panicky

TECHNIQUE 4: BILATERAL STIMULATION
- Cross-body movements (march in place)
- Alternate tapping knees with opposite hands
- Figure-8 arm movements
- Integrates left/right brain hemispheres
- Use when: feeling scattered or disconnected

TECHNIQUE 5: GROUNDING THROUGH FEET
- Feel feet connection to ground
- Press feet firmly into floor
- Walk mindfully, noticing each step
- Activates safety through embodiment
- Use when: feeling spacey or dissociated

[INTEGRATION TIP]
Practice these when you're already calm so they're available when you need them."

### [8:30-10:30] Co-Regulation with Your Baby
[VISUAL: Mother and baby in calm connection]

"You and your baby regulate each other:

YOUR CALM AFFECTS BABY:
- Babies feel your nervous system state
- Your regulated breathing calms them
- Your relaxed body helps them relax
- Your peaceful energy is contagious

BABY'S CALM AFFECTS YOU:
- Contentment is biologically rewarding
- Successful soothing builds confidence
- Peaceful moments restore your system
- Oxytocin release from connection

CO-REGULATION PRACTICES:

SYNCHRONIZED BREATHING:
- Hold baby skin-to-skin
- Breathe slowly and deeply
- Let baby's breathing synchronize with yours
- Creates mutual nervous system regulation

CALM COMMUNICATION:
- Speak in low, slow, melodic tones
- Use gentle facial expressions
- Move slowly and purposefully
- Models regulation for baby's developing system

MINDFUL CAREGIVING:
- Full presence during feeding/changing
- Notice baby's cues and responses
- Appreciate moments of connection
- Use routine care as regulation practice

[WHEN BABY IS DYSREGULATED]
Remember: You can't regulate a dysregulated baby from a dysregulated state. Regulate yourself first, then offer that calm to your baby.

[CO-REGULATION INSIGHT]
Every moment of calm connection with your baby is building their lifelong capacity for regulation. You're literally shaping their nervous system."

### [10:30-12:00] Building Your Regulation Toolkit
[VISUAL: Personalized toolkit creation]

"Create your personal nervous system regulation kit:

IMMEDIATE TECHNIQUES (0-30 seconds):
- Physiological sigh
- Cold water on wrists
- Feel feet on ground
- Hum or sing one note

SHORT-TERM TECHNIQUES (1-5 minutes):
- Progressive muscle relaxation
- Bilateral movements
- Mindful breathing
- Gentle self-massage

LONGER REGULATION (10+ minutes):
- Warm bath or shower
- Gentle yoga or stretching
- Nature time
- Creative activities

ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORTS:
- Soft lighting
- Calming music or sounds
- Comfortable textures
- Pleasant scents
- Organized spaces

SOCIAL REGULATION:
- Calm presence of trusted person
- Talking with understanding friend
- Professional support
- Community connection

[PERSONALIZATION]
What techniques resonate most with you? What feels most accessible in your daily life?

[REGULATION SCHEDULE]
- Morning: Set nervous system intention
- Throughout day: Use micro-regulation techniques
- Evening: Longer regulation practice
- Weekly: Assessment and adjustment

[REMEMBER]
Regulation is a skill that improves with practice. Start where you are, be patient with the process."

### [12:00-13:00] Integration and Daily Practice
[VISUAL: Integration into daily life]

"This week's nervous system practices:

‚òê Daily physiological sighs (minimum 3)
‚òê One longer regulation practice daily
‚òê Co-regulation awareness with baby
‚òê Environmental regulation supports
‚òê Weekly nervous system state check-in

[TRACKING YOUR STATES]
Throughout the day, simply notice:
- What state is my nervous system in right now?
- What helped me feel more regulated today?
- What triggered dysregulation?
- How quickly did I return to calm?

[PATIENCE WITH THE PROCESS]
Building nervous system flexibility takes time. Be as patient with yourself as you would be with your baby learning any new skill.

Next lesson: We explore mindfulness practices adapted specifically for exhausted mothers.

[NERVOUS SYSTEM BLESSING]
May your nervous system remember its capacity for peace. May your body feel safe. May your breath be your anchor to calm.

You're building the foundation for lifelong resilience - for yourself and your children."

# LESSON 3: MINDFULNESS FOR ANXIOUS MOTHERS
*Duration: 14 minutes | Slides: 20*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - Redefining Mindfulness for Moms
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana with gentle, accessible energy]

"Welcome back, mindful mama. If traditional meditation makes you feel more anxious, if sitting still makes your mind race faster, if focusing on your breath triggers panic - this lesson is especially for you.

We're going to completely reimagine mindfulness for the realities of motherhood.

[MINDFULNESS MISCONCEPTIONS]
Mindfulness is NOT:
- Emptying your mind
- Sitting perfectly still
- Feeling calm all the time
- Another thing to perfect
- Spiritual bypassing of difficult emotions

[MINDFULNESS FOR MOTHERS IS]
- Gentle awareness of what's happening now
- Kindness toward your experience
- Brief moments of presence
- Integration into daily activities
- Tool for riding emotional waves

[LIBERATION]
You don't need to become a meditation teacher. You just need to befriend your present moment experience - messy, imperfect, and beautifully human as it is."

### [1:30-3:30] Mindfulness Adaptations for New Mothers
[VISUAL: Traditional vs. mom-adapted mindfulness comparison]

"Why traditional mindfulness needs adaptation:

TRADITIONAL APPROACH CHALLENGES:
- Requires sustained attention (you have none)
- Often emphasizes stillness (you're constantly moving)
- Can increase body awareness (triggering for trauma)
- Assumes quiet environment (babies don't cooperate)
- Focuses on internal experience (you need external awareness too)

MOM-ADAPTED MINDFULNESS:

MICRO-MINDFULNESS:
- 30-second practices
- Woven into existing activities
- Work with interruptions
- Build from tiny moments

MOVEMENT-BASED:
- Walking meditation
- Mindful baby care
- Gentle stretching with awareness
- Conscious breathing during activity

EYES-OPEN PRACTICES:
- Visual meditation (watching baby)
- Mindful observation of environment
- Present-moment sensory awareness
- Connection-based practices

TRAUMA-INFORMED:
- Choice about body awareness
- Emphasis on safety and control
- External anchors when internal feels unsafe
- Gentle and gradual approach

[MINDFULNESS PRINCIPLE]
Any moment of kind awareness counts. There's no minimum time requirement for mindfulness to be beneficial."

### [3:30-6:00] Everyday Mindfulness Practices
[VISUAL: Daily activities transformed into mindfulness practices]

"Transform routine activities into mindfulness practices:

MINDFUL FEEDING (bottle or breast):
- Notice the warmth of baby in your arms
- Feel the rhythm of baby's sucking
- Observe baby's facial expressions
- Appreciate this moment of nourishment
- Let feeding time be meditation time

MINDFUL WALKING:
- Feel feet contacting ground with each step
- Notice air moving across your skin
- Observe changing scenery
- Coordinate breathing with steps
- Use stroller pushing as walking meditation

MINDFUL LISTENING:
- When baby cries, listen with curiosity not panic
- Notice different types of cries
- Hear sounds in your environment
- Listen to your partner with full attention
- Use baby's babbling as meditation bell

MINDFUL TOUCH:
- Feel water temperature during baths
- Notice textures of baby's clothes
- Appreciate softness of baby's skin
- Feel your own breath moving your body
- Use gentle self-touch for comfort

MINDFUL SEEING:
- Really look at baby's face
- Notice light and shadow in your room
- Observe baby's movements and expressions
- Appreciate colors and shapes around you
- Use visual beauty as meditation object

[INTEGRATION WISDOM]
You're already spending time on these activities. Adding gentle awareness transforms them into mindfulness practice without requiring extra time."

### [6:00-8:30] Working with Anxious Thoughts Mindfully
[VISUAL: Thoughts as clouds passing through sky]

"Mindful approaches to anxious thinking:

OBSERVING THOUGHTS WITHOUT BELIEVING THEM:
- Notice: 'I'm having a worried thought'
- Label: 'Anxiety thinking' or 'Catastrophic thinking'
- Investigate: 'Is this thought helpful right now?'
- Redirect: Gently return attention to present moment

THE WEATHER METAPHOR:
- Thoughts are like weather patterns in your mind
- Some days are stormy (lots of anxious thoughts)
- Some days are clear (peaceful thinking)
- You are the sky - vast and unchanging
- Weather always passes through

THOUGHT NOTING PRACTICE:
- When you notice worried thinking, simply note: 'Worrying'
- When mind is planning obsessively, note: 'Planning'
- When catastrophizing, note: 'Catastrophizing'
- No judgment, just gentle acknowledgment

THE CURIOUS OBSERVER:
Instead of: 'Why am I thinking this terrible thought?'
Try: 'Isn't it interesting how my mind works?'

Instead of: 'I need to stop these thoughts'
Try: 'I notice my mind is very active right now'

[MINDFUL ANXIETY RESPONSES]
When anxiety arises:
1. Pause and breathe
2. Notice: 'Anxiety is here'
3. Soften: Relax face, jaw, shoulders
4. Ground: Feel feet, notice surroundings
5. Kindness: 'This is a moment of suffering. May I be kind to myself.'

[INSIGHT]
You don't need to fix your thoughts. You just need to change your relationship with them."

### [8:30-11:00] Loving-Kindness for the Overwhelmed Mother
[VISUAL: Heart-centered imagery with gentle colors]

"Loving-kindness practice adapted for motherhood:

TRADITIONAL LOVING-KINDNESS:
'May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be at peace'

MOTHER-ADAPTED LOVING-KINDNESS:
'May I be gentle with myself in this challenging time'
'May I remember I'm learning and growing'
'May I know I'm doing the best I can'
'May I feel supported and not alone'

FOR WHEN YOU'RE STRUGGLING:
'May I forgive myself for not being perfect'
'May I remember this difficult moment will pass'
'May I ask for help when I need it'
'May I treat myself with the kindness I show my baby'

FOR YOUR ANXIOUS MIND:
'May my worried thoughts be held with compassion'
'May I trust my ability to handle whatever comes'
'May my anxiety be met with understanding'
'May I find peace within uncertainty'

FOR YOUR BABY:
'May my baby feel my love even when I'm struggling'
'May my baby be safe and healthy'
'May my baby know they are cherished'
'May my love for my baby guide me to self-care'

FOR OTHER STRUGGLING MOTHERS:
'May all mothers struggling right now feel less alone'
'May all mothers be gentle with themselves'
'May all mothers find the support they need'
'May all mothers remember their strength and wisdom'

[PRACTICE NOTES]
- Choose phrases that feel authentic to you
- If traditional phrases feel forced, create your own
- Start with self-kindness - you can't give what you don't have
- Use during baby care, walking, or quiet moments

[LOVING-KINDNESS INSIGHT]
Every moment of self-compassion you practice, you're modeling emotional health for your child."

### [11:00-12:30] Mindful Boundaries and Saying No
[VISUAL: Boundary-setting with mindful awareness]

"Mindful boundary setting for overwhelmed mothers:

MINDFUL AWARENESS OF YOUR LIMITS:
- Check in with body: What is my energy level?
- Notice emotions: What am I feeling about this request?
- Assess capacity: What do I realistically have to give?
- Honor truth: What would be honest for me right now?

MINDFUL PAUSE BEFORE RESPONDING:
- When asked to do something, pause
- Take three breaths
- Check in with yourself
- Respond from awareness, not automatic patterns

COMPASSIONATE NO'S:
'I care about this, and I don't have capacity right now'
'I want to be helpful, and I need to prioritize my family's needs'
'Thank you for thinking of me. I'm not available for this right now'
'I appreciate the invitation. This isn't the right time for me'

MINDFUL YES'S:
Before saying yes, ask:
- Does this align with my values?
- Do I have genuine energy for this?
- Will this add to or deplete my wellbeing?
- What would I need to say no to in order to say yes to this?

[BOUNDARY MANTRAS]
'My no is sacred - it protects my yes'
'I can disappoint others and still be a good person'
'My energy is finite and precious'
'Setting boundaries is self-care, not selfishness'

[MINDFUL BOUNDARY PRACTICE]
This week, before agreeing to anything:
1. Pause
2. Breathe
3. Check in with yourself
4. Respond from awareness

[BOUNDARY WISDOM]
Every boundary you set mindfully teaches your children about self-respect and healthy relationships."

### [12:30-14:00] Creating Your Mindful Day
[VISUAL: A day structured with mindful moments]

"Design a mindfully integrated day:

MORNING MINDFUL MOMENTS:
- Three conscious breaths before getting out of bed
- Mindful first sip of coffee/tea
- Loving intention for the day
- Gentle body awareness while baby feeds

MIDDAY MINDFUL RESET:
- One minute of mindful breathing
- Mindful hand washing
- Appreciate one beautiful thing you see
- Quick body scan and tension release

EVENING MINDFUL WIND-DOWN:

- Gentle awareness of gratitude

[MINDFUL PARENTING MOMENTS]
- Really see your baby's face during care
- Listen mindfully to baby's sounds
- Feel the weight and warmth of baby in your arms
- Notice your love as it arises naturally

[EMERGENCY MINDFULNESS]
When overwhelm hits:
1. Name it: 'Overwhelm is here'
2. Breathe: One slow, conscious breath
3. Ground: Feel feet, notice surroundings
4. Kindness: 'This is hard. May I be gentle with myself'
5. Action: What one thing needs attention right now?

[WEEK 4 INTEGRATION]
This week's practices:
‚òê Daily micro-mindfulness moments
‚òê Mindful anxiety awareness
‚òê Loving-kindness practice
‚òê Mindful boundary setting
‚òê Emergency mindfulness when needed

[CLOSING INTENTION]
May your mindfulness be gentle and forgiving.
May your awareness bring you peace, not pressure.
May you find moments of calm within the beautiful chaos of motherhood.

Next lesson: We integrate everything into a sustainable anxiety management system.

Remember: Mindfulness isn't about perfection. It's about presence, kindness, and coming home to yourself, over and over again."

### [3:30-6:00] The Three-Tier Anxiety Management System
[VISUAL: Three-tier pyramid with prevention, intervention, recovery]

"Your comprehensive anxiety management system:

TIER 1: PREVENTION (Daily Foundation)
Building anxiety resilience through lifestyle:

NERVOUS SYSTEM SUPPORT:
- Regular sleep schedule (as much as possible)
- Nutrition that stabilizes blood sugar
- Gentle movement or stretching
- Daily nervous system regulation practice

STRESS REDUCTION:
- Realistic expectations and boundaries
- Adequate support systems
- Regular joy and pleasure activities
- Mindful daily living practices

TIER 2: INTERVENTION (When Anxiety Rises)
Immediate response to anxiety symptoms:

EARLY INTERVENTION (at first signs):
- Physiological sigh (double inhale, long exhale)
- Name it: 'I notice anxiety arising'

[VISUAL: Parent and child in calm interaction]

"Managing anxiety while parenting:

MODELING ANXIETY MANAGEMENT:
- Your children learn emotional regulation by watching you
- Showing them healthy coping teaches life skills
- It's okay for children to see you work through emotions
- Narrate your coping: 'Mommy is feeling worried, so I'm taking deep breaths'

WHEN ANXIETY INTERFERES WITH PARENTING:

IF YOU'RE TOO ANXIOUS TO BE PRESENT:
- Use grounding techniques first
- Remember: regulated parent = regulated child
- It's okay to take a moment to calm yourself
- Ask for help when you need it

IF PARENTING TRIGGERS ANXIETY:
- Identify specific triggers (baby crying, tantrums, etc.)
- Have plan for each trigger
- Practice responses when calm
- Build confidence through small successes

TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT EMOTIONS:
- Name emotions: 'I see you're feeling frustrated'
- Validate feelings: 'It makes sense that you're upset'
- Model coping: 'When I feel upset, I take deep breaths'
- Problem-solve together: 'What might help you feel better?'

[ANXIETY AS TEACHER]
Your experience with anxiety makes you a more empathetic, emotionally aware parent. You're uniquely qualified to help your children with their big feelings.

[PARENTING AFFIRMATIONS]
'I can be anxious and still be a good parent'
'My children benefit from seeing me take care of myself'
'Teaching emotional regulation is one of the greatest gifts I can give'
'I'm learning alongside my children'"
