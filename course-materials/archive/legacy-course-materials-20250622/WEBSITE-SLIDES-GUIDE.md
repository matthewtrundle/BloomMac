# Course Slides as Website Pages - The Perfect Solution! 🎉

## What I've Built for You

I've created a professional slide system **within your existing Bloom Psychology website** that works perfectly for both Loom recording AND student access.

### 📁 Files Created:

1. **`/app/course/week1/page.tsx`** - Week 1 overview page

- ✅ **Uses your existing design system** - Matches your brand perfectly
- ✅ **Students can access anytime** - No file downloads needed
- ✅ **Perfect for Loom recording** - Just navigate through pages
- ✅ **Mobile-friendly** - Moms can review on phones
- ✅ **Integrated with your site** - Feels like part of the course
- ✅ **Easy to update** - Just edit the page content
