## Lesson 1: Welcome to Your Fourth Trimester (8 minutes)

### [0:00-0:30] Opening - Warm Welcome

[VISUAL: Your face, warm smile, sitting comfortably]

"Hi there, mama. I'm Dr. Jana, and I want to start by saying something really important: The fact that you're here, taking this course, shows incredible strength. You're prioritizing your mental health during one of the most challenging transitions of your life, and that takes courage.

So welcome. Welcome to this safe space we're creating together."

### [0:30-1:30] Creating Our Container

[VISUAL: Soft slide with "This Space Is..." bullet points appearing]

"Before we dive in, I want you to know what this space is and isn't. 

This space IS:
- A judgment-free zone where all feelings are valid
- A place to learn practical, evidence-based strategies
- Your time to focus on YOU, not just baby

This space is NOT:
- A replacement for medical care or therapy
- A place where you need to be perfect
- Somewhere you'll be shamed for struggling

[VISUAL: Transition back to your face]

Take a deep breath with me. [Pause for breath] You belong here exactly as you are right now - whether you're in your PJs, haven't showered in days, or crying as you watch this. You're in the right place."

### [1:30-3:00] Understanding the Fourth Trimester

[VISUAL: Slide showing "The Fourth Trimester" with timeline graphic]

"You've probably heard of the three trimesters of pregnancy, but did you know there's actually a fourth? The fourth trimester is the first three months after birth - though honestly, the adjustment period often lasts much longer.

[VISUAL: Infographic showing physical, emotional, and social changes]

During this time, you're experiencing:
- Major physical recovery - your body just did something extraordinary
- Massive hormonal shifts - bigger than puberty and menopause combined
- Identity transformation - you're becoming a new version of yourself
- Relationship changes - with your partner, family, even friends
- And oh yeah, you're keeping a tiny human alive on no sleep!

[VISUAL: Back to your face, compassionate expression]

When you think about it that way, is it any wonder you might be struggling? This isn't weakness - this is a normal response to an enormous life change."

### [3:00-4:30] Why This Matters

[VISUAL: Slide with statistics, appearing one by one]

"Let me share some numbers that might help you feel less alone:
- Up to 80% of new mothers experience the 'baby blues'
- 15-20% develop postpartum depression
- 10% experience postpartum anxiety
- And these numbers are likely higher because many moms don't report their struggles

[VISUAL: Back to you]

But here's what I want you to really hear: These aren't just statistics. Each number represents a mom like you, trying her best while facing real challenges. Mental health struggles after birth are COMMON, they're TREATABLE, and most importantly, they're NOT YOUR FAULT."

### [4:30-6:00] What We'll Cover Together

[VISUAL: Course overview slide with week-by-week breakdown]

"Over the next six weeks, we'll journey together through:

Week 1 (This week): Understanding your new reality
Week 2: Working with difficult thoughts
Week 3: Rebuilding joy and meaningful activities  
Week 4: Managing anxiety and worry
Week 5: Strengthening relationships and communication
Week 6: Creating your long-term wellness plan

[VISUAL: Slide showing lesson format]

Each week includes:
- Video lessons like this one (short enough to watch while nursing!)
- A downloadable workbook with exercises
- A guided meditation practice
- Real strategies you can use immediately

[VISUAL: Back to you]

Everything is designed for real moms with real lives - nothing here requires hours of free time or perfect conditions."

### [6:00-7:00] Your Fourth Trimester Rights

[VISUAL: Beautiful slide with "Your Fourth Trimester Rights" - suitable for screenshot]

"I want to leave you with something important. These are your Fourth Trimester Rights - screenshot this and put it somewhere you'll see it:

You have the right to:
- Feel however you feel without judgment
- Ask for and receive help
- Prioritize your own wellbeing
- Make mistakes as you learn
- Rest when you need to
- Seek professional support
- Define motherhood on your own terms

[VISUAL: Back to you]

These aren't luxuries - these are necessities for your mental health."

### [7:00-8:00] This Week's Foundation

[VISUAL: Slide with simple homework assignment]

"Your only homework this week is to watch these four lessons and do one simple thing: Place your hand on your heart once a day and say, 'I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough.'

[VISUAL: Back to you, hand on your own heart]

Let's try it together now. Hand on heart. 'I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough.'

I'm so glad you're here. When you're ready, move on to the next lesson where we'll talk about what's happening in your body during this recovery period.

Remember, you can always pause, come back, rewatch. This is YOUR journey, at YOUR pace.

See you in the next lesson."

[VISUAL: Soft fade to course logo]

## Lesson 2: Your Body After Birth: What to Expect (10 minutes)

### [0:00-0:45] Opening - Normalizing the Conversation

[VISUAL: Your face, relaxed and approachable]

"Welcome back. In this lesson, we're going to have an honest conversation about your postpartum body. And I do mean honest - we're going to talk about things like bleeding, sweating, and yes, even that first postpartum poop.

Why? Because when you know what's normal, you worry less. And when you worry less, you can focus on healing.

[VISUAL: Slide with disclaimer text]

Quick note: While I'll share what's typical, every body is unique. Always trust your instincts and contact your healthcare provider if something feels wrong."

### [0:45-2:30] The First Six Weeks

[VISUAL: Timeline graphic showing weeks 1-6 postpartum]

"Let's start with what's happening in these early weeks:

[VISUAL: Week 1-2 highlights]

Weeks 1-2:
- Lochia (vaginal bleeding) - yes, even with a C-section
- Uterine cramping as it shrinks back
- Perineum soreness or C-section incision care
- Breast engorgement as milk comes in
- The infamous night sweats - your body releasing pregnancy fluids

[VISUAL: Week 3-4 highlights]

Weeks 3-4:
- Bleeding lightening but still present
- Hemorrhoids improving (slowly!)
- Core and pelvic floor still very weak
- Fatigue that feels bone-deep
- Hair starting to shed - don't panic!

[VISUAL: Week 5-6 highlights]

Weeks 5-6:
- Bleeding usually stopping
- First postpartum period might arrive
- Energy slowly improving (emphasis on slowly)
- Emotions still on a roller coaster
- Body starting to feel more like yours

[VISUAL: Back to you]

Notice I said 'starting' to feel like yours. Full recovery takes much longer than six weeks, despite what society tells us."

### [2:30-4:30] The Hidden Recovery (Months 2-12)

[VISUAL: Slide titled "The Recovery Nobody Talks About"]

"Here's what continues happening after that '6-week clearance':

[VISUAL: List appearing with gentle animations]

Months 2-6:
- Core and pelvic floor still healing (takes up to a year!)
- Hormones continuing to fluctuate
- Hair loss peaks around month 3-4 (it will grow back!)
- Sleep deprivation accumulating
- Breastfeeding affecting your cycle and mood

Months 6-12:
- Body finding its new normal
- Hormones stabilizing (especially after weaning)
- Energy gradually improving
- Physical strength slowly returning

[VISUAL: Back to you, empathetic expression]

I share this not to discourage you, but to give you permission to be patient with yourself. Your body did something miraculous. It deserves time and gentleness to heal."

### [4:30-6:30] Warning Signs: When to Call Your Provider

[VISUAL: Important warning signs slide with red highlights]

"While most recovery is normal, some symptoms need immediate attention:

Call your provider RIGHT AWAY if you have:
- Heavy bleeding (soaking a pad in an hour)
- Fever over 100.4°F
- Severe headaches or vision changes
- Difficulty breathing or chest pain
- Thoughts of harming yourself or baby
- Signs of infection at incision/tear sites
- Severe abdominal pain

[VISUAL: Additional concerns slide]

Also reach out for:
- Persistent pain that's not improving
- Inability to urinate or have bowel movements
- Excessive swelling in legs/face
- Feeling extremely anxious or depressed
- Any concern that feels urgent to you

[VISUAL: Back to you]

Remember: You're not bothering anyone by calling. Your health matters."

### [6:30-8:30] Supporting Your Physical Recovery

[VISUAL: Slide with practical tips]

"So how can you support your body through this recovery?

[VISUAL: REST tips]

REST (Even though it feels impossible):
- Sleep when baby sleeps (yes, really)
- Lie down even if you can't sleep
- Ask for help with night feeds if possible
- Lower all standards for housework

[VISUAL: NOURISHMENT tips]

NOURISH:
- Eat regularly (set phone reminders)
- Focus on easy, nutritious foods
- Stay hydrated (especially if breastfeeding)
- Continue prenatal vitamins

[VISUAL: GENTLE MOVEMENT tips]

MOVE GENTLY:
- Start with basic breathing exercises
- Add gentle walks as you feel able
- Wait for clearance for exercise
- Listen to your body's limits

[VISUAL: HEALING SUPPORT tips]

SUPPORT HEALING:
- Use ice packs or witch hazel pads
- Take prescribed pain medication
- Do pelvic floor exercises (gently!)
- Consider pelvic floor physical therapy"

### [8:30-10:00] Closing: Your Body, Your Pace

[VISUAL: Back to you, warm and encouraging]

"I want to end with this: Your postpartum body might not look or feel like your pre-pregnancy body. That's okay. It might never be exactly the same - and that's okay too.

This body grew a human. It birthed a human. It's sustaining a human. It deserves your respect, your patience, and your care.

[VISUAL: Slide with affirmation]

Let's do today's affirmation together: 'My body is healing at exactly the right pace. I honor all it has done and continues to do.'

[VISUAL: Back to you]

In our next lesson, we'll explore the emotional side of this journey - all those big feelings you might be experiencing. They're just as important as the physical healing we talked about today.

Take care of yourself, mama. See you in the next lesson."

[VISUAL: Gentle fade to course logo]

## Lesson 3: Emotional Waves: Understanding Postpartum Feelings (12 minutes)

### [0:00-1:00] Opening - Permission to Feel

[VISUAL: Your face, soft and understanding expression]

"If you've cried today - whether from joy, exhaustion, frustration, or for no reason at all - you're in good company. If you've felt angry, anxious, numb, or all of the above in the span of an hour, that's okay too.

This lesson is about understanding the emotional roller coaster of early motherhood. We're going to talk about why you might feel like a different person, why your emotions feel so big, and most importantly, what's normal versus when to reach out for more support.

[VISUAL: Soft transition slide]

So grab a tissue if you need one. This is a safe space for all your feelings."

### [1:00-3:00] The Science Behind the Emotions

[VISUAL: Brain and hormone illustration - simple, not medical]

"Let's start with what's happening in your body that affects your emotions:

[VISUAL: Hormone drop graph]

After birth, your hormones experience the most dramatic drop they'll ever have:
- Estrogen and progesterone plummet from their pregnancy highs
- Prolactin surges if you're breastfeeding
- Oxytocin ebbs and flows with feeding and bonding
- Cortisol (stress hormone) often stays elevated

[VISUAL: Brain changes illustration]

Meanwhile, your brain is literally rewiring itself:
- Areas for vigilance and protection grow
- Emotional processing intensifies
- Memory and focus temporarily suffer (hello, mom brain!)
- Empathy and bonding circuits strengthen

[VISUAL: Back to you]

So when you feel like you're not yourself, you're right - you're becoming a new version of yourself. It's beautiful AND it's hard."

### [3:00-5:00] The Emotional Spectrum

[VISUAL: Emotional wheel showing various feelings]

"Let's normalize the wide range of emotions you might experience:

[VISUAL: Common emotions appearing one by one]

You might feel:
- LOVE: Overwhelming, fierce, protective love
- JOY: Moments of pure happiness and wonder
- GUILT: About everything and nothing
- ANXIETY: Constant worry about baby's wellbeing
- SADNESS: Grieving your old life
- ANGER: At partner, situation, or yourself
- NUMBNESS: Feeling disconnected or empty
- FEAR: Of not being good enough

[VISUAL: Back to you, very direct eye contact]

Here's what I need you to hear: ALL of these feelings can exist at the same time. You can desperately love your baby AND miss your old life. You can feel grateful AND overwhelmed. You can be a good mother AND struggle with difficult emotions.

[VISUAL: Text overlay: "Both/And, Not Either/Or"]

This is 'both/and' not 'either/or.'"

### [5:00-7:00] Baby Blues vs. Something More

[VISUAL: Comparison chart]

"Now let's talk about the difference between 'baby blues' and when you might need additional support:

[VISUAL: Baby Blues characteristics]

Baby Blues (50-80% of new moms):
- Starts day 2-3 postpartum
- Peaks around day 5
- Usually resolves by 2 weeks
- Crying, mood swings, irritability
- Able to care for baby and self
- Moments of joy mixed in

[VISUAL: When to Seek Help]

Seek Support When:
- Symptoms last beyond 2 weeks
- Getting worse, not better
- Can't sleep even when baby sleeps
- No interest in baby or excessive worry
- Thoughts of harming self or baby
- Unable to eat or care for yourself
- Feeling hopeless or worthless

[VISUAL: Back to you, serious but warm]

Remember: Seeking help is not failure. It's the bravest thing you can do for yourself and your baby. Postpartum depression and anxiety are medical conditions, not character flaws."

### [7:00-9:00] The Feelings Nobody Talks About

[VISUAL: Your face, creating safe space with your tone]

"Can we talk honestly about some feelings that moms often hide?

[VISUAL: Soft slide with each point appearing gently]

It's normal to sometimes feel:
- Regret about becoming a mother
- Resentment toward your baby or partner
- Fantasies about running away
- Disconnected from your baby
- Like you made a mistake
- Scared you'll never feel like yourself again

[VISUAL: Back to you, very compassionate]

These thoughts don't make you a bad mother. They make you human. They're often symptoms of exhaustion, hormone changes, and overwhelm - not reflections of your true feelings or abilities as a mother.

[VISUAL: Important note slide]

The difference is: These are passing thoughts, not plans. If they become plans or constant thoughts, that's when we reach out for professional help immediately."

### [9:00-11:00] Immediate Coping Strategies

[VISUAL: Practical strategies slide]

"When big emotions hit, here's what you can do right now:

[VISUAL: PAUSE technique]

Use the PAUSE technique:
- P: Pause and notice what you're feeling
- A: Accept the feeling without judgment
- U: Use a coping strategy
- S: Seek support if needed
- E: Evaluate what you need next

[VISUAL: In-the-moment strategies]

Quick Coping Strategies:
- Box breathing: 4 counts in, hold 4, out 4, hold 4
- Cold water on wrists or face
- Step outside for fresh air
- Call a friend who gets it
- Put baby safely down and take 5 minutes
- Repeat a calming phrase: 'This will pass'

[VISUAL: Daily emotional support]

Daily Emotional Care:
- Name your emotions out loud
- Journal for 5 minutes
- Connect with one person
- Move your body gently
- Practice self-compassion
- Celebrate tiny victories"

### [11:00-12:00] Closing: You're Not Alone

[VISUAL: Back to you, hand on heart]

"I want to leave you with this truth: Whatever you're feeling right now, thousands of other mothers have felt it too. You're not broken. You're not failing. You're adjusting to the biggest life change imaginable.

[VISUAL: Community message slide]

In our online community, you'll find other moms sharing their real experiences. Use each other. Support each other. Remind each other that this is hard AND you're doing it.

[VISUAL: Back to you]

Your homework: Notice and name three emotions today without judging them. Just notice: 'Oh, I'm feeling anxious.' 'I'm feeling grateful.' 'I'm feeling frustrated.' 

Naming our emotions is the first step in managing them.

In our final lesson this week, we'll put it all together and create your personal foundation for healing.

Until then, be gentle with yourself. You're doing better than you think."

[VISUAL: Fade to course logo with soft music]

## Lesson 4: Building Your Foundation for Healing (9 minutes)

### [0:00-0:45] Opening - Integration

[VISUAL: Your face, energetic but calm]

"Welcome to our final lesson of Week 1. We've covered a lot - your physical recovery, your emotional landscape, and now we're going to put it all together to create your personal foundation for healing.

Think of this foundation like building a house. You need strong supports in multiple areas to weather the storms that might come. Today, we're going to identify your support beams."

### [0:45-2:30] The Four Pillars Framework

[VISUAL: Four pillars graphic building one by one]

"Your postpartum wellness rests on four main pillars:

[VISUAL: Pillar 1 - Physical]

Pillar 1 - PHYSICAL WELLNESS:
- Rest and recovery
- Nutrition and hydration
- Gentle movement
- Medical care

[VISUAL: Pillar 2 - Emotional]

Pillar 2 - EMOTIONAL WELLNESS:
- Processing feelings
- Self-compassion
- Joy and connection
- Professional support when needed

[VISUAL: Pillar 3 - Practical]

Pillar 3 - PRACTICAL SUPPORT:
- Help with daily tasks
- Childcare backup
- Household management
- Financial planning

[VISUAL: Pillar 4 - Community]

Pillar 4 - COMMUNITY CONNECTION:
- Partner relationship
- Family support
- Friend network
- Professional team

[VISUAL: Back to you]

When one pillar is weak, the others have to work harder. Our goal is to strengthen each one, even if just a little bit."

### [2:30-4:30] Assessing Your Current Foundation

[VISUAL: Self-assessment slide]

"Let's do a quick assessment. For each pillar, rate yourself from 1-10:

[VISUAL: Interactive-looking scale for each]

Physical Wellness: How supported is your body's healing?
Emotional Wellness: How well are you managing emotions?
Practical Support: How much help do you have day-to-day?
Community Connection: How connected do you feel to others?

[VISUAL: Back to you]

There's no judgment here - just information. Most new moms score low in at least one area, often several. That's why we're here - to build up these supports.

Write down your numbers. We'll revisit them in Week 6 to see how far you've come."

### [4:30-6:30] Your Minimum Viable Wellness Plan

[VISUAL: Simple daily plan graphic]

"Now let's create what I call your 'Minimum Viable Wellness Plan' - the absolute basics you need each day:

[VISUAL: Daily Non-negotiables]

Daily Non-negotiables (pick 3 to start):
□ One full glass of water every 2 hours
□ One nutritious meal (even if delivered)
□ 5 minutes of fresh air
□ One text to a supportive person
□ Shower or wash face
□ 3 deep breaths when overwhelmed
□ Hand on heart with kind words
□ Ask for one specific help

[VISUAL: Back to you]

Notice these are TINY actions. We're not aiming for perfection - we're aiming for sustainable, doable, daily practices that add up over time.

[VISUAL: Phone reminder note]

Right now, pause this video and set one phone reminder for tomorrow. Just one. Maybe it says 'Drink water' or 'Text Sarah.' Start there."

### [6:30-8:00] Creating Your Support Map

[VISUAL: Support system diagram]

"Finally, let's map out your support system. Think of it like creating your personal emergency contacts:

[VISUAL: Fill-in worksheet style]

My Support Map:
- When I need to vent: ____________
- When I need practical help: ____________
- When I need professional guidance: ____________
- When I need a laugh: ____________
- When I need emergency care: ____________

[VISUAL: Resource list]

If you're struggling to fill this in, consider:
- Postpartum support groups
- Online communities
- Therapists specializing in maternal mental health
- Postpartum doulas
- Lactation consultants
- Your OB/midwife
- Pediatrician

[VISUAL: Back to you]

Having this map means when you're in crisis, you don't have to think - you just look at your list and call."

### [8:00-9:00] Closing: You've Already Started

[VISUAL: Your face, proud and encouraging]

"I want to congratulate you. By watching these four lessons, you've already started building your foundation. You've:
- Learned what's normal in recovery
- Understood your emotional experiences
- Identified areas needing support
- Created initial plans for wellness

[VISUAL: Week 1 summary slide]

This week, focus on:
1. Watching for warning signs
2. Practicing one daily wellness habit
3. Reaching out to one support person
4. Being incredibly kind to yourself

[VISUAL: Back to you, warm smile]

Next week, we'll dive into managing those difficult thoughts that might be swirling in your head. We'll learn practical tools from cognitive behavioral therapy to help you think more clearly and kindly.

[VISUAL: Closing affirmation]

Let's close with our Week 1 affirmation: 'I am building a strong foundation for my wellness, one small step at a time.'

You're doing amazing work, mama. Rest when you can, and I'll see you next week.

Remember: You can rewatch any lesson, anytime. This is your course, at your pace, for your healing.

Take care of yourself. You deserve it."
