# LESSON 1: THE POSTPARTUM MIND - UNDERSTANDING YOUR THOUGHTS
*Duration: 11 minutes | Slides: 17*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - Normalizing the Mental Chaos
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana, calm presence amid swirling thoughts graphic]

"Welcome back, brave mama. This week we're diving into the landscape of your mind - not to judge what we find there, but to understand it with compassion.

If your thoughts feel chaotic, repetitive, or scary right now - that's not a personal failing. That's a nervous system responding to massive change while running on minimal sleep.

[REVOLUTIONARY INSIGHT]
Your postpartum brain is actually DESIGNED to be hypervigilant right now. The same neurobiology that keeps your baby safe can make your mind feel like a tornado. Today we learn to dance with this tornado instead of fighting it.

[CLINICAL WISDOM]
In 15 years of practice, I've learned: You cannot think your way out of a dysregulated nervous system. But you can change your relationship to your thoughts - and that changes everything."

### [1:30-3:30] The Postpartum Cognitive Storm
[VISUAL: Beautiful thought bubbles showing common patterns]

"Let's normalize what's happening in your mind:

HYPERVIGILANCE THOUGHTS:
'Is the baby breathing?'
'Did I lock the door?'
'What if something happens to baby while I sleep?'
'Am I doing everything wrong?'

COMPARISON & JUDGMENT THOUGHTS:
'Other moms seem to have it together'
'I should be enjoying this more'
'I'm not as good at this as I thought I'd be'
'Everyone else looks so happy on social media'

CATASTROPHIC THINKING:
'I'll never feel like myself again'
'I've ruined my life'
'What if I never bond with my baby?'
'I can't do this'

PERFECTIONISM THOUGHTS:
'I should be grateful for everything'
'Good mothers don't feel this way'
'I need to be strong for everyone'
'I can't ask for help'

[VALIDATION]
If you recognize these thoughts - welcome to the club. These aren't character flaws. They're predictable patterns of a brain trying to manage the unmanageable."

### [3:30-5:30] The Neuroscience of Postpartum Thinking
[VISUAL: Brain networks, simplified and beautiful]

"Your thinking patterns right now are shaped by:

HORMONAL INFLUENCES:
- Low estrogen: Affects mood regulation and memory
- Fluctuating progesterone: Impacts anxiety and sleep
- Elevated cortisol: Keeps threat-detection system active
- Oxytocin surges: Intensify emotional responses

NEURAL NETWORK CHANGES:
- Default Mode Network: More active (more rumination)
- Salience Network: Hyperactive (everything feels urgent)
- Executive Control: Temporarily reduced (harder to focus)

SLEEP DEPRIVATION EFFECTS:
- Reduced prefrontal cortex function
- Increased emotional reactivity
- Impaired cognitive flexibility
- Heightened stress response

[REFRAME]
Your 'anxious thoughts' are your brain trying to predict and prevent every possible threat to your baby. It's love expressed through worry.

Your 'negative thoughts' are your psyche processing grief and identity change.

Your 'racing thoughts' are your mind trying to solve the unsolvable puzzle of perfect motherhood.

None of this is wrong. All of it makes sense."

### [5:30-7:00] Thoughts vs. Truth - The Fundamental Distinction
[VISUAL: Thought clouds vs. solid ground of truth]

"The most revolutionary concept in cognitive therapy:

THOUGHTS ARE NOT FACTS.

Thoughts are:
- Mental events, like weather patterns in your mind
- Influenced by hormones, sleep, and stress
- Often outdated programming from past experiences
- Your brain's attempt to make sense of complexity
- Sometimes helpful, sometimes not

Truths are:
- You are learning something completely new
- You are doing your best with your current resources
- Your baby is lucky to have you
- Struggling doesn't mean failing
- Getting help is strength, not weakness

[PRACTICE MOMENT]
Next time you notice a difficult thought, try:
'I'm having the thought that...' instead of 'I think...'

Example:
'I'm having the thought that I'm a terrible mother'
vs.
'I am a terrible mother'

Feel the difference? The first creates space. The second creates suffering."

### [7:00-9:00] The Observer Self - Meeting Your Wise Witness
[VISUAL: Peaceful observer watching thoughts like clouds]

"Inside you is a part that can observe your thoughts without being overwhelmed by them. We call this the Observer Self or Wise Witness.

Your Observer Self:
- Notices thoughts without judging them
- Stays calm even when thoughts are chaotic
- Knows the difference between thinking and being
- Can choose which thoughts deserve attention
- Holds compassion for all parts of your experience

CULTIVATING THE OBSERVER (Practice):
1. Notice you're thinking: 'Oh, I'm thinking right now'
2. Name the type of thought: 'Worry thought' or 'Criticism thought'
3. Thank your mind: 'Thanks, mind, for trying to protect me'
4. Choose your response: 'Is this thought helpful right now?'

[GUIDED PRACTICE]
Let's try this together:
Bring to mind a recent worry about your baby...
Now step back and observe that thought...
Notice: You are not the thought. You are the one observing the thought.
You are the sky, not the weather."

### [9:00-10:30] This Week's Cognitive Practices
[VISUAL: Simple, practical tools]

"Your cognitive toolkit for Week 2:

DAILY THOUGHT NOTICING (2 minutes):
- Set phone reminders 3x daily
- Simply notice: 'What thoughts are here right now?'
- No judgment, just awareness
- Record patterns in your phone

THOUGHT LABELING PRACTICE:
- Worry thoughts: 'Thanks, mind, for being cautious'
- Criticism thoughts: 'Thanks, mind, for trying to motivate me'
- Comparison thoughts: 'Thanks, mind, for trying to help me fit in'

THE 5-MINUTE THOUGHT DOWNLOAD:
- Every evening, write thoughts for 5 minutes
- Stream of consciousness, no editing
- Notice what shows up repeatedly
- Then close the notebook - thoughts have been heard

[ASSIGNMENT]
Choose ONE practice to commit to this week. Consistency matters more than perfection."

### [10:30-11:00] Bridge & Closing
[VISUAL: Hopeful transition]

"Remember: The goal isn't to stop difficult thoughts. It's to change your relationship with them.

Next lesson: We learn specific techniques for challenging unhelpful thought patterns.

For now, practice being curious about your thoughts instead of scared of them. They're not your enemy - they're information.

You're doing beautifully, observer mama."

# LESSON 2: COGNITIVE DEFUSION - UNHOOKING FROM DIFFICULT THOUGHTS
*Duration: 13 minutes | Slides: 19*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - From Fusion to Freedom
[VISUAL: Tangled vs. free imagery]

"Welcome back, thoughtful warrior. Last lesson we learned to observe thoughts. Today we learn to unhook from the ones that hurt.

Cognitive fusion is when we're so tangled up in our thoughts that we can't see they're just thoughts. It's like being inside a fishbowl instead of looking at the fishbowl from outside.

[COMMON FUSION EXAMPLES]
'I'm a bad mother' (fused)
vs.
'I'm having the thought that I'm a bad mother' (defused)

'This is too hard' (fused)
vs.
'I notice my mind saying this is too hard' (defused)

Defusion creates space. Space creates choice. Choice creates freedom."

### [1:30-3:30] The Top 5 Postpartum Cognitive Distortions
[VISUAL: Thought distortion types with examples]

"Let's name the most common thinking traps:

1. ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING
'If I'm not perfect, I'm a failure'
'Either I'm a good mom or a bad mom'
'I should be able to handle everything'

2. MIND READING
'My partner thinks I'm incompetent'
'Other moms judge my parenting'
'The pediatrician thinks I'm overreacting'

3. FORTUNE TELLING
'I'll never enjoy motherhood'
'My baby will be damaged by my struggles'
'I'll always feel this overwhelmed'

4. EMOTIONAL REASONING
'I feel guilty, so I must be doing something wrong'
'I feel anxious, so something bad will happen'
'I don't feel bonded, so I'm a bad mother'

5. SHOULD STATEMENTS
'I should be grateful all the time'
'I shouldn't need this much help'
'I should know how to do this naturally'

[INSIGHT]
These aren't personal flaws - they're universal human thinking patterns amplified by stress, hormones, and sleep deprivation."

### [3:30-6:00] Defusion Techniques - The Liberation Toolkit
[VISUAL: Each technique beautifully illustrated]

"Here are proven techniques to unhook from difficult thoughts:

TECHNIQUE 1: THE LABELING METHOD
Instead of: 'I'm terrible at this'
Try: 'I'm having a self-criticism thought'

TECHNIQUE 2: THE SINGING METHOD
Take your harsh thought and sing it to 'Happy Birthday'
Example: Sing 'I'm-a-ter-ri-ble-moth-er' to the tune
Hard to take seriously when sung!

TECHNIQUE 3: THE SILLY VOICE METHOD
Say your thought in Mickey Mouse voice or like Darth Vader
Changes the emotional charge instantly

TECHNIQUE 4: THE THANK YOU METHOD
'Thank you, mind, for that thought'
'Thanks for trying to protect me'
'I appreciate your concern'

TECHNIQUE 5: THE COMPUTER METAPHOR
'My mind is running the "Bad Mother" program again'
'Oh, there's the "Everything is Terrible" software'

TECHNIQUE 6: THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
'This thought has a history - it's familiar'
'Where did I first learn to think this way?'
'Whose voice does this sound like?'

[PRACTICE MOMENT]
Think of a recent difficult thought... Now try 2-3 techniques with it. Notice what shifts."

### [6:00-8:00] The RAIN Method for Difficult Emotions
[VISUAL: Gentle rain imagery with method steps]

"When thoughts trigger strong emotions, use RAIN:

R - RECOGNIZE
'What am I feeling right now?'
'What thoughts are present?'
'What's happening in my body?'

A - ALLOW
'Can I let this be here without fixing it?'
'What if I didn't resist this feeling?'
'Can I make space for this experience?'

I - INVESTIGATE WITH KINDNESS
'What does this feeling need?'
'What would I say to a friend feeling this?'
'Where do I feel this in my body?'

N - NON-IDENTIFICATION
'I am not this thought or feeling'
'This is a temporary experience passing through me'
'I am the sky, not the weather'

[GUIDED PRACTICE]
Let's use RAIN with whatever you're feeling right now...
[Walk through each step slowly]

Notice: You can feel difficult things without being destroyed by them."

### [8:00-10:00] Creating Your Personal Defusion Phrases
[VISUAL: Personalized phrase examples]

"Develop your own defusion language:

FOR ANXIETY THOUGHTS:
'My protective system is very active today'
'My mind is working hard to keep us safe'
'This is my hypervigilant brain doing its job'

FOR SELF-CRITICISM:
'My inner critic is loud today'
'This is leftover programming from childhood'
'My perfectionist part is afraid'

FOR CATASTROPHIC THOUGHTS:
'My mind is playing the disaster movie again'
'This is my brain trying to prepare for everything'
'What if... thoughts are visiting'

FOR COMPARISON THOUGHTS:
'My comparison mind is online'
'I'm measuring my insides against their outsides'
'Everyone's just doing their best'

[PERSONALIZATION EXERCISE]
What phrases resonate with you? What language feels gentle and effective?

Create 3 personal defusion phrases for your most common difficult thoughts."

### [10:00-12:00] The Cognitive Flexibility Practice
[VISUAL: Multiple perspectives illustration]

"Cognitive flexibility is the ability to see situations from multiple angles:

THE THREE PERSPECTIVES PRACTICE:

1. THE STRESSED PERSPECTIVE (how it feels in the moment)
'This is impossible, I can't handle this'

2. THE WISE FRIEND PERSPECTIVE (what you'd tell a friend)
'You're learning something incredibly difficult. Of course you're struggling. This is temporary.'

3. THE FUTURE SELF PERSPECTIVE (looking back in 5 years)
'I remember how hard those early months were. I was doing the best I could with what I had. I'm proud of how I persevered.'

[DAILY PRACTICE]
When caught in difficult thoughts, ask:
- What would I tell my best friend in this situation?
- How might I see this differently in a year?
- What would someone who loves me say right now?
- What information am I missing?
- What assumptions am I making?

Perspective-taking is a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets."

### [12:00-13:00] Integration & Next Steps
[VISUAL: Tools coming together]

"This week's practice menu (choose 2-3):

â–¡ Daily thought defusion using your favorite technique
â–¡ RAIN practice when emotions are intense
â–¡ Three perspectives practice for stuck situations
â–¡ Evening thought download with compassionate review
â–¡ Personalized defusion phrase development

Remember: The goal isn't to eliminate difficult thoughts. It's to hold them lightly instead of being held captive by them.

Next lesson: We move from individual thoughts to thought patterns and core beliefs.

You're rewiring your brain with every practice. That's not metaphor - that's neuroscience."

---

# LESSON 3: CORE BELIEFS & IDENTITY SHIFTS
*Duration: 14 minutes | Slides: 20*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - Beneath the Surface Thoughts
[VISUAL: Iceberg metaphor with thoughts above, beliefs below]

"Welcome back, identity explorer. We've worked with individual thoughts. Now we go deeper - to the core beliefs that drive those thoughts.

Core beliefs are like the operating system of your mind. They're often unconscious assumptions about yourself, others, and the world that were formed early in life.

[EXAMPLES]
Surface thought: 'I should know how to do this'
Core belief: 'I must be competent to be worthy of love'

Surface thought: 'I'm burdening everyone'
Core belief: 'My needs are too much for others'

Becoming a mother activates every core belief you have about:
- Your worthiness
- Your capability
- Your lovability
- Your safety in the world

Today we make the unconscious conscious."

### [1:30-4:00] Identifying Your Core Beliefs
[VISUAL: Belief archaeology - gently uncovering layers]

"Common postpartum core belief activations:

WORTHINESS BELIEFS:
'I'm only valuable if I'm perfect'
'I don't deserve help unless I'm completely overwhelmed'
'My worth depends on being needed'
'I must earn love through sacrifice'

CAPABILITY BELIEFS:
'I should be able to handle everything myself'
'Asking for help means I'm weak'
'If it's hard, I'm doing it wrong'
'Good mothers know instinctively what to do'

SAFETY BELIEFS:
'The world is dangerous and I must be hypervigilant'
'Something bad will happen if I'm not perfect'
'I can't trust others to care for my baby properly'
'Relaxing means I'm being irresponsible'

CONNECTION BELIEFS:
'I'm different from other mothers'
'I don't fit in anywhere'
'Everyone else has it figured out'
'I'm alone in this struggle'

[REFLECTION PROMPT]
Which of these feel familiar? Notice without judgment - these beliefs often served you once but may not serve you now."

### [4:00-6:30] The Archaeology of Beliefs - Where They Come From
[VISUAL: Gentle family tree or timeline imagery]

"Core beliefs usually form from:

CHILDHOOD MESSAGES:
- Spoken: 'Good girls don't ask for help'
- Unspoken: Parent overwhelmed, child learns 'I'm too much'
- Cultural: 'Mothers should sacrifice everything for children'

PAST EXPERIENCES:
- Trauma: 'I must be hypervigilant to be safe'
- Rejection: 'I must be perfect to be loved'
- Criticism: 'I'm not good enough as I am'

SOCIETAL PROGRAMMING:
- 'Motherhood should be natural and joyful'
- 'Strong women don't struggle'
- 'You should be grateful for what you have'

[COMPASSIONATE REFRAME]
These beliefs aren't character flaws. They were adaptive responses to your environment. A child who learned 'I must be perfect to be safe' was responding intelligently to their situation.

The question now is: Do these beliefs serve your current reality?

[GENTLE INQUIRY]
- What did you learn about mothers/motherhood growing up?
- What messages did you receive about asking for help?
- How was struggle or difficulty handled in your family?
- What beliefs about worthiness did you absorb?

No need to analyze deeply - just notice what arises."

### [6:30-9:00] Challenging and Updating Core Beliefs
[VISUAL: Software update metaphor]

"We don't eliminate core beliefs - we update them:

OLD BELIEF: 'I must be perfect to be worthy of love'
UPDATED BELIEF: 'I am worthy of love especially when I'm imperfect and learning'

OLD BELIEF: 'I should be able to handle everything myself'
UPDATED BELIEF: 'Accepting help is how I can be my best self for my family'

OLD BELIEF: 'Good mothers don't struggle'
UPDATED BELIEF: 'Good mothers are human and seek support when needed'

THE BELIEF UPDATE PROCESS:

1. IDENTIFY THE OLD BELIEF
'What core belief is driving this thought pattern?'

2. EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE
'Is this belief absolutely true?'
'What evidence contradicts this belief?'
'How has this belief helped and hurt me?'

3. CONSIDER THE ORIGIN
'Where did I learn this belief?'
'Was it helpful in that context?'
'Is it helpful in my current context?'

4. CRAFT AN UPDATED BELIEF
'What would be a more helpful, accurate belief?'
'What would I want my daughter to believe?'
'What belief would serve my wholeness?'

5. PRACTICE THE NEW BELIEF
'How can I live this new belief today?'
'What actions align with this new belief?'
'How can I remind myself of this new truth?'"

### [9:00-11:30] Motherhood Identity Integration
[VISUAL: Venn diagram of identities merging]

"Becoming a mother involves identity reorganization:

WHO YOU WERE:
- Individual with your own needs, goals, rhythms
- Person with established sense of self
- Someone with freedom and autonomy

WHO YOU'RE BECOMING:
- Caregiver responsible for another's wellbeing
- Person learning entirely new skills
- Someone whose life is interconnected with another's

THE INTEGRATION CHALLENGE:
How do you honor both - your individual self AND your mother self?

REFRAME: You're not losing yourself. You're expanding yourself.

BOTH/AND IDENTITY STATEMENTS:
- I can be a loving mother AND have my own needs
- I can prioritize my baby AND prioritize my wellbeing
- I can be grateful for my child AND grieve my old life
- I can love motherhood AND find it difficult
- I can be a good mother AND be imperfect
- I can be strong AND need support

[IDENTITY INTEGRATION PRACTICE]
Complete these sentences:
'Before becoming a mother, I was...'
'As a mother, I am becoming...'
'I want to integrate these parts by...'

Both versions of you are valid. Both deserve honoring."

### [11:30-13:00] Creating New Empowering Beliefs
[VISUAL: Seeds growing into strong trees]

"Let's plant new beliefs that serve your flourishing:

MOTHERHOOD EMPOWERMENT BELIEFS:
- 'Learning to be a mother is one of life's greatest growth opportunities'
- 'My struggles make me more compassionate, not less worthy'
- 'Asking for help models healthy interdependence for my child'
- 'My wellbeing and my baby's wellbeing are interconnected'
- 'I can trust my instincts while also seeking guidance'
- 'Motherhood is a practice, not a performance'

PERSONAL WORTH BELIEFS:
- 'I am inherently worthy, regardless of my performance'
- 'My value doesn't depend on being perfect'
- 'I deserve care, support, and gentleness'
- 'My needs matter and deserve attention'

CAPABILITY BELIEFS:
- 'I am learning and growing every day'
- 'I have inner wisdom I can trust'
- 'I can figure things out with support'
- 'Mistakes are information, not failures'

[BELIEF AFFIRMATION PRACTICE]
Choose 3 beliefs that resonate most deeply.
Write them in your own words.
Say them with your hand on your heart.
Notice any resistance - that's normal.
Commit to reminding yourself of these truths daily."

### [13:00-14:00] Integration & Future Visioning
[VISUAL: Path forward with integrated identity]

"This week's practices:

â–¡ Daily belief awareness: 'What belief is driving this thought?'
â–¡ Weekly belief update: Choose one belief to gently challenge
â–¡ Identity integration journaling: Honoring all parts of yourself
â–¡ New belief affirmations: 3 empowering beliefs daily

[FUTURE VISIONING]
Imagine yourself 6 months from now, living from these new beliefs:
- How do you treat yourself?
- How do you ask for support?
- How do you handle challenges?
- What does self-compassion look like?

This isn't fantasy - this is practicing your future self.

Next lesson: We put it all together - creating sustainable cognitive wellness practices.

You're not just changing thoughts - you're updating the blueprint of your mind."

# LESSON 4: COGNITIVE WELLNESS INTEGRATION
*Duration: 12 minutes | Slides: 18*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - From Skills to Lifestyle
[VISUAL: Tools coming together into integrated practice]

"Welcome to our final Week 2 lesson, cognitive architect. We've learned to observe thoughts, defuse from unhelpful ones, and update core beliefs. Now we integrate these skills into sustainable daily practices.

Cognitive wellness isn't about perfect thinking - it's about flexible, compassionate thinking. It's developing a wise, kind relationship with your mind.

[TRANSFORMATION CHECKPOINT]
Take a moment to notice: How has your relationship with your thoughts shifted this week? Even small changes matter."

### [1:30-3:30] The Cognitive Wellness Framework
[VISUAL: Beautiful framework diagram]

"Your cognitive wellness rests on four pillars:

1. AWARENESS (The Foundation)
- Noticing thoughts without being consumed by them
- Recognizing patterns and triggers
- Understanding the difference between thoughts and truth

2. DEFUSION (The Liberation)
- Unhooking from unhelpful thoughts
- Creating space between you and your thinking
- Holding thoughts lightly

3. FLEXIBILITY (The Adaptation)
- Seeing situations from multiple perspectives
- Updating beliefs that no longer serve
- Responding rather than reacting

4. SELF-COMPASSION (The Integration)
- Speaking to yourself with kindness
- Treating yourself as you would a good friend
- Accepting imperfection as human

[INTEGRATION INSIGHT]
These aren't separate skills - they work together as a unified approach to mental wellness."

### [3:30-6:00] Creating Your Personal Cognitive Toolkit
[VISUAL: Customizable toolkit with various tools]

"Build your personalized cognitive toolkit:

FOR ANXIOUS THOUGHTS:
â–¡ Grounding techniques (5-4-3-2-1 sensory)
â–¡ Probability check ('How likely is this really?')
â–¡ Worst/best/most likely scenario
â–¡ 'What would I tell a friend?' perspective

FOR SELF-CRITICAL THOUGHTS:
â–¡ Self-compassion break
â–¡ 'What would someone who loves me say?'
â–¡ Evidence for and against the criticism
â–¡ Reframe as learning opportunity

FOR OVERWHELMING THOUGHTS:
â–¡ Thought downloading (brain dump on paper)
â–¡ Priority sorting (urgent vs. important)
â–¡ One-thing focus ('What's the next right step?')
â–¡ Support activation ('Who can help with this?')

FOR CATASTROPHIC THOUGHTS:
â–¡ Present moment anchoring
â–¡ Fact vs. fear distinction
â–¡ Coping statement preparation
â–¡ Support system reminder

[PERSONALIZATION]

A meditation focusing on:
- Observing thoughts without attachment
- Practicing cognitive defusion
- Cultivating the wise observer
- Integrating self-compassion with awareness
