# Alex Hormozi's Audit: Bloom Psychology Cart & Offers

*"Alright, let's cut through the BS and look at what actually makes money..."*

## üéØ The Brutal Truth About Your Current Offer Stack

### What You're Doing Wrong:

**1. You're Selling Courses When You Should Be Selling TRANSFORMATIONS**
- Nobody wakes up wanting a "6-week postpartum course"
- They wake up wanting to "stop feeling like a failure as a mom"
- They want to "feel like themselves again"
- They want their partner to stop asking "what's wrong?" every day

**Your new positioning:**
- ‚ùå "Postpartum Wellness Foundations Course"
- ‚úÖ "From Survival Mode to Supermom in 6 Weeks"

**2. Your Packages Are Named Like a Damn Hotel**
- Bronze, Silver, Gold? Really?
- This isn't the Olympics
- Name them what they actually deliver

**New names:**
- Bronze ‚Üí "Kickstart Package"
- Silver ‚Üí "Total Transformation"
- Gold ‚Üí "Done-With-You System"
- Platinum ‚Üí "White Glove Recovery"

## üí∞ The Money Is In The GAP

**The GAP:** Where they are NOW vs. Where they WANT to be

**Current State (Their Hell):**
- Can't sleep even when baby sleeps
- Snapping at partner daily
- Crying in the shower
- Googling "am I a bad mom?" at 3am
- Feel like their body is broken
- Lost their identity

**Dream State (Their Heaven):**
- Confident in their mothering
- Connected to their partner
- Energy to enjoy their baby
- Feel sexy again
- Have a plan that works
- Actually happy

**Your offer needs to BRIDGE that gap FAST.**

## üöÄ My Recommendations to 10X This Thing

### 1. **Scarcity That Actually Matters**

Stop with "limited time" BS. Real scarcity:
- "Dr. Jana only has 8 spots this month for 1:1 support"
- "Workbook reviews close Friday at midnight (next batch in 2 weeks)"
- "Partner Integration Kit bonus expires when timer hits zero"

### 2. **The Grand Slam Offer Formula**

**Dream Outcome** + **Perceived Likelihood** + **Time Delay** + **Effort/Sacrifice** = **Value**

Your current offer:
- Dream Outcome: ‚úÖ Good (feel better as a mom)
- Likelihood: ‚ùå Not clear (where's the proof?)
- Time: ‚ùå 6 weeks feels long
- Effort: ‚ùå Sounds like work

**The fix:**
- Add "Feel better in 48 hours or your money back"
- Show 500+ success stories prominently
- Include "Quick Win" exercises for Day 1
- Make it feel EASY: "Just 10 minutes a day"

### 3. **Stack The Value (Properly)**

You're underselling. Here's how to present the Silver package:

```
Total Transformation Package Includes:

‚úì Postpartum Recovery Program (Value: $497)
‚úì Complete Personal Workbook Analysis by Dr. Jana ($497)
‚úì 3 Emergency Support Sessions ($297)
‚úì Partner Training System ($197)
‚úì Physical Wellness Kit ($197)
‚úì Lifetime Access & Updates ($297)
‚úì Private Facebook Group ($197)
‚úì Monthly Q&A with Dr. Jana ($597)

Total Real Value: $2,876
Today Only: $1,297
You Save: $1,579 (55% OFF)
```

### 4. **Urgency That Creates ACTION**

**Hormozi's Urgency Stack:**
1. Cohort-based urgency: "This month's group starts Monday"
2. Bonus urgency: "First 10 get 1:1 session with Dr. Jana"
3. Price urgency: "Goes up $200 next week"
4. Availability urgency: "17 moms on waitlist for these 25 spots"

### 5. **The Godfather Offer**

Make an offer so good they feel stupid saying no:

**"The Postpartum Promise"**
- Try the complete program for 30 days
- If you don't feel 50% better, you pay NOTHING
- PLUS we'll donate $100 to postpartum charity in your name
- PLUS you keep all the materials

*"We can only make this offer because we KNOW it works"*

### 6. **Testimonial Amplification**

You need testimonials at EVERY friction point:
- Add to cart ‚Üí "Sarah added this and said it saved her marriage"
- Price concern ‚Üí "I was scared of the price but it paid for itself when I could work again"
- Time concern ‚Üí "I only had 10 minutes a day and it still worked"

**Power Testimonial Format:**
"I went from [SPECIFIC STRUGGLE] to [SPECIFIC WIN] in just [TIME]"

### 7. **The Decoy Effect**

Your Gold package is priced too close to Platinum. Fix:

- Kickstart: $397
- Total Transformation: $1,297 
- Done-With-You: $2,497 (was $1,897)
- White Glove: $3,997

Now Platinum looks like a better deal, and more people buy it.

### 8. **Payment Psychology**

Stop saying "payment plans available." Say:
- "Start for just $97 today"
- "Most moms choose 3 payments of $433"
- "0% interest always - we're not a bank"

### 9. **The Hormozi Close**

On your checkout page, add:

**"Look, I get it.** You're exhausted. You've tried everything. You're wondering if spending money on yourself makes you selfish.

**Here's the truth:** Your baby needs a mom who's OK. Your partner needs the woman they fell in love with back. And you? You deserve to feel human again.

**This works.** 500+ moms prove it. But only if you start. The next 5 minutes determine the next 5 years of your life as a mother.

**Choose yourself. Your family needs you to.**

[Complete Order - Start for $97]"

### 10. **Backend Value Ladder**

You're leaving money on the table. After they buy:

**Day 1**: "Welcome! Here's your login + surprise bonus"
**Day 7**: "How's it going? Book your first review"
**Day 14**: "You're doing great! Want faster results?" ‚Üí Fast Track upsell
**Day 30**: "Success! Ready for the next level?" ‚Üí New Mom Program
**Day 90**: "You've transformed! Become a mentor?" ‚Üí Certification program

## üé¨ The One Thing That Matters

**Stop selling courses. Start selling CERTAINTY.**

Every mom is thinking: "Will this work for ME?"

Answer that question so hard they can't say no:
- Show moms EXACTLY like them
- Address their EXACT concerns
- Promise EXACT outcomes
- In EXACT timeframes

## üí£ Hormozi's Final Recommendations

### Do These TODAY:
1. Change all package names to outcome-based
2. Add a ridiculous guarantee 
3. Create real urgency (cohort-based)
4. Stack value properly (show the math)
5. Add testimonials EVERYWHERE

### Stop Doing These:
1. Weak CTAs like "Learn More"
2. Talking about features instead of outcomes
3. Hiding your prices
4. Being "professional" when you should be REAL
5. Competing on price instead of value

### The Million Dollar Question:
"Would I buy this for my wife after our first kid?"

If the answer isn't "HELL YES," keep working.

## üèÜ The Bottom Line

You have a great product. But great products don't sell themselves. 

**Great OFFERS sell.**

Make the offer so good that buying is the obvious decision. Make NOT buying feel like the risky choice.

Remember: You're not taking their money. You're solving their problem. The money is just how they say thank you.

Now stop reading and go implement. Money loves speed.
