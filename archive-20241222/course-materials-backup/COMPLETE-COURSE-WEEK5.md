# LESSON 1: UNDERSTANDING RELATIONSHIP CHANGES IN MOTHERHOOD
*Duration: 13 minutes | Slides: 19*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - The Relationship Revolution
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana with warm, understanding energy]

"Welcome to Week 5, relationship architect. Becoming a mother doesn't just change you - it changes every single relationship in your life. Your partnership, friendships, family dynamics, even your relationship with yourself - all are being reorganized.

If your relationships feel strained, distant, or completely different than before, you're not failing. You're experiencing one of the most profound relationship transitions possible.

[NORMALIZATION]
Every relationship in your life is learning how to relate to the new version of you. And you're learning how to be in relationship as a mother. This takes time, patience, and a lot of grace.

[HOPE MESSAGE]
Relationships that seem damaged or distant now can become deeper and more authentic than ever before. The key is understanding what's happening and having tools to navigate the changes.

Today we map the territory of relationship change so you can move through it with wisdom and intention."

### [1:30-3:30] The Attachment System Reorganization
[VISUAL: Attachment network diagram showing changes]

"Your attachment system is completely reorganizing:

BEFORE BABY:
- Primary attachment often with partner
- Friendships based on shared interests/activities
- Family relationships in established patterns
- Identity relatively stable
- Freedom to focus on relationship needs

AFTER BABY:
- Baby becomes primary attachment focus
- All other relationships adjust to this reality
- Everyone needs to find their new place
- Your needs and capacity change dramatically
- Relationships must adapt or strain

THE ATTACHMENT HIERARCHY SHIFT:
1. Baby's survival needs (biological imperative)
2. Your basic survival needs (to care for baby)
3. Partner relationship (adapting to new reality)
4. Family relationships (finding new dynamics)
5. Friendships (often deprioritized temporarily)

[KEY INSIGHT]
This isn't permanent prioritization - it's temporary reorganization. As you stabilize in motherhood, you can reinvest in other relationships with intention.

[VALIDATION]
Feeling like you've 'lost yourself' in relationships is normal when your entire attachment system is restructuring. You haven't lost yourself - you're expanding to include new connections while learning to maintain existing ones."

### [3:30-6:00] Common Relationship Challenges and Why They Happen
[VISUAL: Challenges with compassionate explanations]

"Understanding why relationships struggle during this transition:

WITH YOUR PARTNER:

CHALLENGE: Feeling like roommates, not lovers
WHY: Survival mode prioritizes function over connection
UNDERLYING NEED: Safety to be vulnerable and intimate again

CHALLENGE: Constant conflict about responsibilities
WHY: Both partners overwhelmed, expectations unclear
UNDERLYING NEED: Clear agreements and mutual support

CHALLENGE: Partner doesn't understand your experience
WHY: They haven't lived the physical/emotional changes
UNDERLYING NEED: Education and empathy building

CHALLENGE: Resentment about unequal load
WHY: Invisible labor becomes visible under stress
UNDERLYING NEED: Recognition and redistribution

WITH FRIENDS:

CHALLENGE: Feeling disconnected from childless friends
WHY: Different life phases, different priorities
UNDERLYING NEED: Acceptance of change, finding new connection points

CHALLENGE: Mom friends feel surface-level
WHY: Exhaustion limits emotional availability
UNDERLYING NEED: Permission for gradual deepening

CHALLENGE: Social anxiety about baby's behavior
WHY: Hypervigilance and social judgment fears
UNDERLYING NEED: Self-compassion and realistic expectations

WITH FAMILY:

CHALLENGE: Boundary conflicts about baby care
WHY: Everyone has opinions about 'right' way to parent
UNDERLYING NEED: Respect for your autonomy as parent

CHALLENGE: Feeling criticized or judged
WHY: Vulnerability activates old family patterns
UNDERLYING NEED: Support without criticism

[SYSTEMIC UNDERSTANDING]
These challenges aren't personal failures - they're predictable responses to a major life transition affecting everyone in your system."

### [6:00-8:30] The Grief of Relationship Change
[VISUAL: Gentle imagery around loss and transformation]

"Acknowledging what you're grieving in relationships:

GRIEF FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP:
- Spontaneous intimacy and connection
- Shared focus and attention
- Freedom for romantic gestures
- Uninterrupted conversations
- Being each other's primary concern
- Time for relationship maintenance

GRIEF FOR FRIENDSHIPS:
- Last-minute social plans
- Carefree time together
- Being fully present without baby concerns
- Shared activities that no longer work
- Energy for deep emotional support
- Being available when friends need you

GRIEF FOR FAMILY DYNAMICS:
- Being the child who receives care
- Family gatherings without responsibility
- Relationships not focused on your parenting
- Privacy about your choices
- Family relationships that existed before baby

[VALIDATION OF GRIEF]
Mourning these losses doesn't mean you don't love your baby or appreciate your new life. It means you're human, and humans grieve change even when it's wanted.

[GRIEF AS BRIDGE]
Allowing yourself to grieve what was creates space for appreciating what's becoming:
- Deeper, more authentic partnerships
- Friendships based on who you really are now
- Family relationships with clearer boundaries
- Connections based on mutual support and understanding

[GRIEF PRACTICE]
This week, allow yourself moments to miss what was while remaining open to what's emerging. Both can be true simultaneously."

### [8:30-11:00] Relationship Values Clarification
[VISUAL: Values exploration with relationship categories]

"Clarifying what matters most in relationships now:

RELATIONSHIP VALUES ASSESSMENT:

CONNECTION VALUES:
- How do you most feel loved and supported?
- What kind of presence do you need from others?
- How do you prefer to give and receive care?
- What makes you feel truly seen and understood?

COMMUNICATION VALUES:
- How do you prefer to handle conflict?
- What communication style helps you feel safe?
- How much processing vs. problem-solving do you need?
- What topics are most important to discuss?

SUPPORT VALUES:
- What kind of help do you most need right now?
- How do you prefer people offer assistance?
- What support feels intrusive vs. helpful?
- How do you want to reciprocate support?

BOUNDARY VALUES:
- What level of involvement feels right with family?
- How much advice/input do you want about parenting?
- What privacy do you need around your struggles?
- How do you want to balance individual and couple needs?

[VALUES-BASED RELATIONSHIP CHANGES]
Some relationships that seemed important before may not align with your current values. Some that seemed peripheral may become central. This is healthy evolution, not betrayal.

[RELATIONSHIP INVENTORY]
Consider each important relationship:
- Does this relationship support my current values?
- What would need to change for this relationship to feel nourishing?
- How can I communicate my needs clearly and kindly?
- What boundaries would help this relationship thrive?

[VALUES COMMUNICATION]
Sharing your relationship values helps others understand how to support you and creates foundation for mutual respect."

### [11:00-12:30] Building Your Support Ecosystem
[VISUAL: Ecosystem diagram with different types of support]

"Creating comprehensive relationship support:

YOUR SUPPORT ECOSYSTEM NEEDS:

1. EMOTIONAL SUPPORT (people who listen and understand)
- Partner who validates your experience
- Friends who offer empathy without advice
- Family members who support without judgment
- Professional counselor or therapist if needed

2. PRACTICAL SUPPORT (people who help with tasks)
- Partner who shares household/baby responsibilities
- Family/friends who offer specific help
- Professional services (cleaning, childcare, etc.)
- Community resources and services

3. INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT (people who provide guidance)
- Healthcare providers you trust
- Experienced parents who share wisdom
- Professional resources (lactation consultant, etc.)
- Reliable sources of parenting information

4. SOCIAL SUPPORT (people who provide connection and fun)
- Friends who make you laugh and feel normal
- Mom groups or communities with shared experiences
- Family members who provide joy and lightness
- Activities that connect you to larger community

[SUPPORT MAPPING EXERCISE]
For each category, identify:
- Who currently provides this support?
- What gaps exist in your support system?
- How could you build or strengthen each area?
- What barriers prevent you from accessing support?

[SUSTAINABLE SUPPORT PRINCIPLES]
- Diversify your support (don't rely on one person for everything)
- Be specific about what you need
- Offer gratitude and reciprocity when possible
- Adjust expectations based on your current capacity
- Remember that support needs change over time

[SUPPORT AFFIRMATION]
'I deserve to be supported. I am worthy of care and help. Building my support system serves not just me, but everyone I love.'"

### [12:30-13:00] Integration and Week 5 Foundation
[VISUAL: Foundation-building imagery]

"This week's relationship foundation practices:

☐ Daily gratitude for one person in your support system
☐ Weekly check-in with your most important relationships
☐ Monthly relationship values assessment
☐ Ongoing support system building and maintenance

[RELATIONSHIP REALITY CHECK]
Relationships in early motherhood require:
- Lower expectations and higher flexibility
- More direct communication and less assumption
- Patience with everyone's adjustment process
- Focus on repair rather than prevention of all conflict

[RELATIONSHIP GROWTH MINDSET]
Every relationship challenge is an opportunity to:
- Communicate more clearly
- Set healthier boundaries
- Deepen authentic connection
- Model healthy relationship skills for your children

Next lesson: We learn specific communication skills for getting your needs met while maintaining connection.

[CLOSING INTENTION]
May you be patient with yourself and others as you all adjust to your new reality. May you find the courage to ask for what you need. May your relationships become sources of strength rather than stress.

Remember: You're not just maintaining relationships - you're transforming them into something that serves the fullest version of yourself."

# LESSON 2: COMMUNICATION SKILLS FOR EXHAUSTED MOTHERS
*Duration: 14 minutes | Slides: 20*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - Communication Under Stress
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana with patient, skilled energy]

"Welcome back, communication architect. When you're sleep-deprived, overwhelmed, and emotionally stretched, effective communication becomes both more important and more challenging.

You might find yourself:
- Snapping at people you love
- Feeling misunderstood constantly
- Unable to articulate what you need
- Avoiding difficult conversations
- Feeling like no one really 'gets it'

[COMMUNICATION REALITY]
Your communication skills haven't disappeared - they're just operating under extreme conditions. Like trying to have a conversation during an earthquake, everything feels harder.

[TODAY'S GIFT]
We're going to learn communication techniques specifically designed for stressed, tired mothers. Simple, effective tools that work even when your brain feels like mush.

These skills will serve you for decades of motherhood, relationship building, and life navigation."

### [1:30-3:30] The NEST Communication Framework
[VISUAL: NEST acronym with warm, nurturing imagery]

"The NEST framework for maternal communication:

N - NAME your experience
E - EXPRESS your needs
S - SET clear boundaries
T - THANK and appreciate

N - NAME YOUR EXPERIENCE:
Instead of: 'I'm fine' (when you're not)
Try: 'I'm feeling overwhelmed and need some support'

Instead of: 'You never help' (blame)
Try: 'I'm struggling to manage everything alone'

[WHY NAMING WORKS]
- Reduces defensiveness in others
- Helps you understand your own experience
- Creates space for empathy and connection
- Moves conversations from blame to understanding

E - EXPRESS YOUR NEEDS:
Instead of: 'You should know what I need'
Try: 'I need you to take the baby for an hour so I can rest'

Instead of: Hoping people will guess
Try: 'Could you bring dinner Tuesday and hold the baby while I shower?'

[WHY EXPRESSING WORKS]
- People want to help but often don't know how
- Specific requests are easier to fulfill
- Clear communication prevents resentment
- Models healthy need expression for children

S - SET CLEAR BOUNDARIES:
Instead of: 'Whatever you think is best'
Try: 'I'm not available for visitors this week'

Instead of: Saying yes when you mean no
Try: 'That doesn't work for me right now'

[WHY BOUNDARIES WORK]
- Protects your energy for what matters most
- Teaches others how to treat you
- Prevents overwhelm and resentment
- Creates space for authentic connection

T - THANK AND APPRECIATE:
Instead of: Focusing only on what's wrong
Try: 'I really appreciate how you handled bedtime last night'

Instead of: Taking support for granted
Try: 'Thank you for listening without trying to fix everything'

[WHY GRATITUDE WORKS]
- Strengthens positive behaviors
- Improves relationship satisfaction
- Shifts focus to what's working
- Creates upward spiral of mutual support"

### [3:30-6:00] Difficult Conversations Made Easier
[VISUAL: Before/after examples of difficult conversations]

"Navigating challenging relationship conversations:

THE 'I' STATEMENT FORMULA:
'I feel _____ when _____ because _____. I need _____.'

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS:

WITH PARTNER ABOUT HELP:
Instead of: 'You never help with the baby'
Try: 'I feel overwhelmed when I'm the only one getting up at night because I'm exhausted. I need us to share night duty.'

WITH FAMILY ABOUT BOUNDARIES:
Instead of: 'You're too intrusive'
Try: 'I feel stressed when I receive a lot of parenting advice because I'm still learning confidence. I need space to figure things out.'

WITH FRIENDS ABOUT CHANGES:
Instead of: 'You don't understand my life now'
Try: 'I feel disconnected when our conversations only focus on my baby because I miss talking about other things too. I need our friendship to include all parts of me.'

THE VALIDATION SANDWICH:
1. Acknowledge their perspective
2. Share your experience
3. Find common ground

EXAMPLE:
'I know you love the baby and want to help [acknowledge]. I'm feeling overwhelmed by the number of visitors right now [share]. Could we work together to create a schedule that feels good for everyone? [common ground]'

THE REPAIR CONVERSATION:
When you've communicated poorly:
1. Take responsibility: 'I was reactive yesterday'
2. Explain context: 'I was exhausted and overwhelmed'
3. Apologize: 'I'm sorry for snapping at you'
4. Recommit: 'I want to communicate better. Can we try again?'

[CONVERSATION TIMING]
- Have important conversations when you're rested (as much as possible)
- Avoid conversations during baby's fussy times
- Ask: 'Is this a good time to talk about something important?'
- Schedule conversations rather than ambushing people"

### [6:00-8:30] Getting Your Needs Met Without Guilt
[VISUAL: Confident, guilt-free need expression]

"Overcoming guilt about asking for help:

COMMON GUILT THOUGHTS:
'I should be able to handle this myself'
'I'm being a burden'
'Others have their own problems'
'Good mothers don't need this much help'
'I should be grateful for what I have'

REFRAMING YOUR NEEDS:

GUILT: 'I'm being selfish asking for help'
REFRAME: 'I'm modeling healthy interdependence for my children'

GUILT: 'I should be able to do this alone'
REFRAME: 'Humans are designed to raise children in community'

GUILT: 'I'm burdening others'
REFRAME: 'I'm giving others opportunities to contribute meaningfully'

GUILT: 'Other people have it harder'
REFRAME: 'Everyone's struggles are valid, including mine'

STRATEGIES FOR GUILT-FREE ASKING:

1. BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED:
Instead of: 'I need help' (vague, overwhelming)
Try: 'Could you hold the baby for 30 minutes while I shower?' (specific, doable)

2. OFFER OPTIONS:
'I need help with dinner. Could you either cook something, pick up takeout, or watch the baby while I cook?'

3. EXPRESS APPRECIATION:
'It would mean so much to me if you could...' or 'I would be incredibly grateful if...'

4. ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR CHOICE:
'No pressure at all, but would you be available to...?'

5. RECIPROCATE WHEN POSSIBLE:
'I can't help with much right now, but I could... in return'

[THE REALITY CHECK]
Most people WANT to help but don't know what you need. Specific requests actually make them feel more useful, not burdened.

[NEED EXPRESSION PRACTICE]
This week, practice asking for one specific thing you need each day. Start small and build confidence."

### [8:30-11:00] Partner Communication Deep Dive
[VISUAL: Partners in supportive conversation]

"Specific strategies for partner communication:

THE DAILY CHECK-IN RITUAL:
5 minutes each evening to share:
- How are you feeling right now?
- What was hardest about today?
- What do you need tomorrow?
- How can I support you?

[KEEPS PROBLEMS FROM BUILDING UP]

THE WEEKLY RELATIONSHIP MEETING:
15-20 minutes weekly to discuss:
- What's working well in our relationship?
- What challenges are we facing?
- How can we support each other better?
- What do we need to plan or problem-solve?

[CREATES PARTNERSHIP MINDSET]

CONFLICT RESOLUTION FOR EXHAUSTED PARENTS:

1. PAUSE RULE:
Either person can call for a 20-minute break during conflict

2. PROBLEM vs. PERSON:
Attack the problem, not each other
'We have a problem with night wakings' vs. 'You never help at night'

3. CURIOSITY BEFORE JUDGMENT:
'Help me understand your perspective' vs. 'You're being unreasonable'

4. SOLUTION FOCUS:
'What would help us both feel better about this?' vs. 'Why can't you just...'

DIVISION OF LABOR CONVERSATIONS:

STEP 1: LIST EVERYTHING
- All household tasks
- All baby care tasks
- All mental/emotional labor

STEP 2: ASSESS CURRENT DIVISION
- Who currently does each task?
- How much time does each take?
- Which tasks are most draining?

STEP 3: NEGOTIATE FAIRLY
- Consider work schedules and energy levels
- Balance physical and mental labor
- Plan for flexibility when someone is sick/overwhelmed

STEP 4: CHECK IN REGULARLY
- Adjust as circumstances change
- Appreciate efforts being made
- Problem-solve challenges together

[INTIMACY COMMUNICATION]
- Be honest about your current capacity
- Distinguish between physical and emotional intimacy
- Communicate about timeline expectations
- Focus on connection over performance

Example: 'I miss being close to you, and I'm not ready for sex yet. Could we spend time cuddling and talking instead?'"

### [11:00-12:30] Social Communication and Boundary Setting
[VISUAL: Confident boundary setting scenarios]

"Communicating with friends, family, and community:

WITH WELL-MEANING BUT INTRUSIVE PEOPLE:

WHEN THEY GIVE UNSOLICITED ADVICE:
'Thank you for caring. I'm feeling good about our current approach.'
'I appreciate you sharing your experience. We're figuring out what works for our family.'

WHEN THEY WANT TO VISIT TOO OFTEN:
'We love seeing you and need to limit visitors to [specific schedule] right now.'
'I'm not up for hosting this week. Could we plan something for next week instead?'

WHEN THEY CRITICIZE YOUR PARENTING:
'I'm confident in this choice for our family.'
'We're doing what feels right for us.'
'I'm not looking for advice right now, just support.'

WITH FRIENDS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND:

WHEN THEY'RE HURT BY YOUR UNAVAILABILITY:
'I miss you too and I'm in a season where I have very limited capacity. This isn't about you - it's about me managing a major life transition.'

WHEN THEY MINIMIZE YOUR EXPERIENCE:
'This is really hard for me right now. I need you to believe me about my experience.'

WHEN THEY EXPECT YOU TO BE THE SAME:
'I'm still me and I'm also different now. I'm learning to balance both.'

BOUNDARY SETTING SCRIPTS:

FOR TIME BOUNDARIES:
'I'm not available for [activity] right now.'
'That doesn't work with my current schedule.'
'I need to prioritize family time this week.'

FOR TOPIC BOUNDARIES:
'I'm not comfortable discussing that.'
'I'd prefer not to get into parenting debates.'
'Let's talk about something else.'

FOR PHYSICAL BOUNDARIES:
'Please ask before holding the baby.'
'We're not having visitors during naptime.'
'I need some space right now.'

[BOUNDARY MAINTENANCE]
- Be consistent with your boundaries
- Don't over-explain or justify
- Expect some people to push back
- Stay calm and repeat your boundary
- Remember: boundaries protect relationships, they don't destroy them"

### [12:30-14:00] Communication as Self-Care
[VISUAL: Communication as nourishment and protection]

"Understanding communication as essential self-care:

COMMUNICATION AS PROTECTION:
- Protects your energy from demanding people
- Protects your time from unwanted obligations
- Protects your mental health from criticism
- Protects your relationships from resentment

COMMUNICATION AS NOURISHMENT:
- Brings you the support you need
- Deepens your connections with others
- Helps you feel seen and understood
- Creates mutual reciprocity and care

COMMUNICATION AS MODELING:
- Shows your children healthy relationship skills
- Demonstrates that their needs matter
- Models how to ask for help
- Shows how to set loving boundaries

COMMUNICATION AFFIRMATIONS:
'My needs are valid and worth expressing'
'I can ask for help without being a burden'
'Setting boundaries is loving, not selfish'
'I deserve to be heard and understood'
'Clear communication serves everyone'

THIS WEEK'S COMMUNICATION PRACTICE:

☐ Use NEST framework in one important conversation
☐ Practice asking for one specific need daily
☐ Set one clear boundary when needed
☐ Have one appreciative/gratitude conversation
☐ Use 'I' statements instead of 'you' statements

[COMMUNICATION GROWTH MINDSET]
Every conversation is practice. Every mistake is learning. Every successful communication builds confidence for the next one.

[INTEGRATION INTENTION]
As you practice these skills, notice:
- How does clear communication affect your stress levels?
- How do people respond to your direct, kind requests?
- What happens to your relationships when you set boundaries?
- How does expressing gratitude change the dynamic?

Next lesson: We focus specifically on building and maintaining friendships during this transitional time.

[CLOSING AFFIRMATION]
May your words be clear and kind. May your needs be expressed and met. May your boundaries be respected. And may your communication create more connection, not less.

Remember: You're not just communicating for today - you're building skills that will serve you and your family for life."

# LESSON 3: BUILDING YOUR MOTHERHOOD VILLAGE
*Duration: 13 minutes | Slides: 18*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - The Village You Need
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana with community-focused, warm energy]

"Welcome back, village builder. 'It takes a village to raise a child' - but nobody tells you how to BUILD that village when you're a exhausted new mother in a culture of individualism.

You might be feeling:
- Isolated and alone in your struggles
- Disconnected from your pre-baby friendships
- Uncertain how to make new mom friends
- Overwhelmed by social expectations
- Guilty for needing so much support

[VILLAGE REALITY]
Most of us don't inherit a ready-made village. We have to intentionally create one. This isn't failure - it's the modern motherhood reality.

[TODAY'S MISSION]
We're going to learn how to identify, build, and maintain the supportive community you need to thrive as a mother. Not perfect relationships, but real, sustaining connections.

Your village doesn't have to be large - it just has to be genuine."

### [1:30-3:30] Understanding Your Village Needs
[VISUAL: Different types of village support illustrated]

"Mapping your village support needs:

THE INNER CIRCLE (1-3 people):
- Your closest confidants
- People you can call at 2am
- Those who know your struggles and love you anyway
- Emergency support for crisis moments

THE SUPPORT CIRCLE (5-8 people):
- Regular emotional and practical support
- People you see/talk to weekly or bi-weekly
- Those who share similar life stage or values
- Mutual support and reciprocity

THE COMMUNITY CIRCLE (larger network):
- Acquaintances who provide light connection
- Activity-based relationships (classes, groups)
- Professional support (doctors, teachers, etc.)
- Broader sense of belonging

VILLAGE FUNCTIONS YOU NEED:

EMOTIONAL SUPPORT:
- Someone to listen without judgment
- Validation of your experiences
- Encouragement during hard times
- Celebration of wins and milestones

PRACTICAL SUPPORT:
- Help with childcare in emergencies
- Meal trains during difficult periods
- Transportation when needed
- Resource sharing and recommendations

INFORMATION SUPPORT:
- Parenting guidance and wisdom
- Local knowledge and connections
- Professional referrals
- Shared experiences and learning

SOCIAL SUPPORT:
- Adult conversation and connection
- Fun and lightness
- Shared activities and interests
- Sense of belonging to community

[VILLAGE ASSESSMENT]
Consider each category:
- Who currently fills this role in your life?
- What gaps exist in your support system?
- What type of support do you most need right now?
- Where could you begin building connections?"

### [3:30-6:00] Navigating Friendship Changes
[VISUAL: Friendship evolution with compassion]

"Understanding how friendships change in motherhood:

WHY FRIENDSHIPS SHIFT:
- Different life priorities and schedules
- Changed capacity for emotional availability
- New needs that old friends may not understand
- Physical exhaustion affecting social energy
- Identity changes affecting connection points

[FRIENDSHIP GRIEF IS NORMAL]
It's okay to mourn friendships that:
- Feel strained or distant now
- No longer fit your current reality
- Require more energy than you have
- Don't provide the support you need

FRIENDSHIP CATEGORIES IN MOTHERHOOD:

FRIENDS WHO GROW WITH YOU:
- Adapt to your new reality
- Show interest in your motherhood journey
- Adjust expectations and communication
- Offer practical and emotional support

FRIENDS WHO STAY THE SAME:
- Maintain your pre-baby connection
- Help you remember who you are beyond motherhood
- Provide continuity and grounding
- May need education about your current needs

FRIENDS WHO DRIFT AWAY:
- Can't or won't adapt to your changes
- May feel hurt by your decreased availability
- Represent different values or life stage
- Natural evolution, not personal failure

NEW FRIENDS YOU DISCOVER:
- Share similar life stage and challenges
- Understand motherhood realities
- Provide specific support for this season
- May become lifelong connections

[FRIENDSHIP MAINTENANCE STRATEGIES]

FOR EXISTING FRIENDSHIPS:
- Communicate about your current capacity
- Suggest new ways to connect (shorter visits, include baby)
- Be honest about what support you need
- Appreciate their efforts to understand

FOR DRIFTING FRIENDSHIPS:
- Allow natural evolution without guilt
- Focus energy on relationships that serve you
- Leave door open for future reconnection
- Honor what the friendship gave you

[FRIENDSHIP REALITY CHECK]
You can't maintain the same number or type of friendships while adjusting to motherhood. This is temporary rebalancing, not permanent loss."

### [6:00-8:30] Building New Mom Connections
[VISUAL: Moms connecting in various settings]

"Creating new motherhood friendships:

WHERE TO MEET OTHER MOMS:

FORMAL OPPORTUNITIES:
- New parent classes (birthing, baby care, etc.)
- Library story times
- Mom groups through hospitals or community centers
- Postnatal fitness classes
- Religious or spiritual communities
- Neighborhood groups or apps

INFORMAL OPPORTUNITIES:
- Parks and playgrounds
- Grocery stores and coffee shops
- Pediatrician waiting rooms
- Walking trails and paths
- Community events
- Online local mom groups

HOW TO INITIATE CONNECTION:

STARTER CONVERSATIONS:
'How old is your baby?' (universal mom conversation starter)
'Do you live in this neighborhood?'
'Have you found any good [services/activities] around here?'
'This is harder than I expected - how are you doing?'

MOVING BEYOND SMALL TALK:
'Would you want to meet for coffee sometime?'
'I'm looking for mom friends - would you be interested in staying in touch?'
'We should exchange numbers in case our kids want playdates someday'
'I'm starting a walking group - would you be interested?'

FIRST HANGOUT IDEAS:
- Coffee while babies nap in strollers
- Walk together with babies
- Park meetup with kids
- Library story time together
- Simple playdate at one person's house

[OVERCOMING CONNECTION BARRIERS]

BARRIER: 'I'm too tired to make new friends'
SOLUTION: Start with very low-key, low-pressure connections

BARRIER: 'I don't know how to make friends as an adult'
SOLUTION: Remember everyone feels awkward - be genuinely interested in others

BARRIER: 'What if they don't like me?'
SOLUTION: Focus on finding YOUR people, not being liked by everyone

BARRIER: 'I don't have time for new friendships'
SOLUTION: Integrate friendship building into activities you're already doing

[MOM FRIEND MATCHING]
Look for moms who:
- Share similar values (not identical parenting styles)
- Have compatible communication styles
- Show genuine interest in friendship
- Live nearby or have similar schedules
- Balance support with respect for boundaries"

### [8:30-11:00] Maintaining Long-Distance and Family Relationships
[VISUAL: Technology connecting distant relationships]

"Nurturing relationships across distance and generations:

LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP MAINTENANCE:

COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES:
- Video calls during baby's alert, happy times
- Voice messages when typing is difficult
- Photo/video sharing of daily moments
- Scheduled calls that work with baby's routine
- Group chats for ongoing connection

MAINTAINING INTIMACY:
- Share real struggles, not just highlight reel
- Ask for specific emotional support
- Include friends in decision-making when appropriate
- Send care packages or thoughtful gifts
- Plan future visits when possible

FAMILY RELATIONSHIP NAVIGATION:

WITH YOUR PARENTS:
- Appreciate their desire to help while setting boundaries
- Educate them about current parenting knowledge
- Ask for specific help rather than general offers
- Share your parenting values clearly and kindly
- Create opportunities for bonding with grandchild

WITH IN-LAWS:
- Communicate through your partner when possible
- Set expectations about visits and involvement
- Find ways to honor their relationship with baby
- Address conflicts directly but respectfully
- Focus on common goal: loving your child

WITH SIBLINGS:
- Be honest about your current capacity
- Ask for understanding during this transition
- Find new ways to connect that work for you
- Maintain interest in their lives when possible
- Plan future activities when you're more available

HANDLING FAMILY CONFLICT:

THE BROKEN RECORD TECHNIQUE:
Repeat your boundary calmly: 'This is what works for our family right now'

THE INFORMATION DIET:
Share less information if it leads to unwanted advice or judgment

THE REDIRECT:
'I appreciate your concern. I'd love to hear about [change subject]'

THE PARTNER BUFFER:
Let your partner handle their family's pushback

[RELATIONSHIP INVESTMENT PRINCIPLES]
- Invest more energy in relationships that support your wellbeing
- Maintain minimal connection with difficult relationships
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Adjust expectations based on your current capacity
- Remember that relationship patterns can change over time"

"Your village building action plan:

THIS WEEK'S VILLAGE PRACTICES:
☐ Reach out to one person for connection
☐ Express gratitude to someone in your support system

MONTHLY VILLAGE ASSESSMENT:
- Who in my village needs more attention?
- What gaps exist in my support system?
- How can I contribute to my community?
- What boundaries need adjusting?
- What relationships bring me joy vs. drain me?

[VILLAGE BUILDING PATIENCE]
Building authentic community takes time:
- Start with one genuine connection

- Focus on quality over quantity
- Allow relationships to develop naturally
- Trust that the right people will emerge

[VILLAGE AFFIRMATIONS]
'I deserve a supportive community'
'I have valuable contributions to make'
'Healthy relationships require mutual effort'
'My village is growing stronger every day'

Next lesson: We explore partnership dynamics and creating a strong co-parenting foundation.

[CLOSING BLESSING]
May you find your people - those who see you, support you, and celebrate you.
May you be brave enough to reach out when you need connection.
May you recognize the village that's already forming around you.
And may you trust that you belong in a community of care.

Remember: Building your village isn't selfish - it's essential. You're not just creating support for yourself, but modeling community for your children."

# LESSON 4: PARTNERSHIP AND CO-PARENTING FOUNDATIONS
*Duration: 14 minutes | Slides: 20*

## ENHANCED SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:30] Opening - Partnership Under Pressure
[VISUAL: Dr. Jana with understanding, hopeful energy]

"Welcome to our final Week 5 lesson, partnership architect. If your relationship feels like it's been through a blender, if you and your partner feel like strangers, if love feels buried under logistics and exhaustion - you're experiencing the normal earthquake of early parenthood.

Every couple goes through this transition. Some emerge stronger, some struggle longer, but all are forever changed.

[PARTNERSHIP REALITY]
Becoming parents doesn't just add a baby to your relationship - it fundamentally reorganizes your entire partnership. Your roles, responsibilities, intimacy, communication, and even your identities as a couple shift dramatically.

[HOPE MESSAGE]
The couples who thrive don't avoid this disruption - they learn to navigate it skillfully. They build new patterns that honor both their individual needs and their partnership while caring for their children.

Today we learn how to not just survive this transition, but use it to create a stronger, more authentic partnership."

### [1:30-3:30] Understanding the Partnership Transition
[VISUAL: Before/after partnership dynamics]

"How parenthood changes your partnership:

BEFORE BABY RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Primary focus on each other
- Flexibility in roles and responsibilities
- Time for relationship maintenance
- Energy for intimacy and connection
- Shared identity as a couple
- Freedom for spontaneous connection

AFTER BABY RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Baby's needs often take priority
- Rigid roles based on logistics
- Relationship maintenance gets postponed
- Exhaustion affects intimacy
- Individual and family identities emerge
- Connection requires intentional planning

COMMON PARTNERSHIP CHALLENGES:

THE SCOREKEEPING TRAP:
'I did more night feeds than you did'
'You got to shower first'
'I always have to ask you to help'

THE ASSUMPTION TRAP:
'You should know what I need'
'If you loved me, you would...'
'We used to be more connected'

THE COMPARISON TRAP:
'Other couples seem happier'
'Your friend's husband does more'
'We used to be better at this'

THE PERFECTIONISM TRAP:
'We should be enjoying this more'
'Good couples don't fight this much'
'We should have figured this out by now'

[NORMALIZATION]
These challenges don't mean your relationship is broken. They mean you're human beings adjusting to one of life's most significant transitions.

[PARTNERSHIP EVOLUTION]
You're not returning to your pre-baby relationship - you're evolving into a family partnership. This requires new skills, agreements, and ways of connecting."

### [3:30-6:00] The Four Pillars of Thriving Partnership
[VISUAL: Four strong pillars supporting a family]

"Building a sustainable family partnership:

PILLAR 1: CLEAR COMMUNICATION
Moving from assumptions to explicit agreements:

DAILY COMMUNICATION:
- Morning check-in: What does each person need today?
- Evening debrief: How did today go? What do we need tomorrow?
- Weekly planning: Logistics, schedules, and relationship time

CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
- Address issues quickly before resentment builds
- Focus on solutions, not blame
- Take breaks when emotions are high
- Repair attempts when you mess up

PILLAR 2: EQUITABLE PARTNERSHIP
Sharing load based on capacity and fairness:

DIVISION OF LABOR:
- List all tasks (household, baby care, mental labor)
- Assess each person's capacity and preferences
- Create agreements that feel fair to both
- Adjust regularly as circumstances change

MENTAL LOAD SHARING:
- Share planning and decision-making responsibilities
- Both partners track schedules and needs
- Alternate who takes lead on different areas
- Recognize and appreciate invisible labor

PILLAR 3: INTENTIONAL CONNECTION
Protecting your relationship while caring for family:

DAILY CONNECTION:
- 15 minutes of undivided attention
- Physical affection (hugs, hand-holding)
- Appreciation expressions
- Check-ins about emotional needs

WEEKLY CONNECTION:
- Date time (even 30 minutes at home)
- Longer conversations about life beyond logistics
- Shared activities you both enjoy
- Physical and emotional intimacy

PILLAR 4: INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT
Supporting each other's individual wellbeing:

SELF-CARE AGREEMENTS:
- Each person gets time for individual restoration
- Support each other's friendships and interests
- Respect individual coping styles
- Encourage professional support when needed

GROWTH SUPPORT:
- Acknowledge how each person is changing
- Support individual goals and dreams
- Appreciate each other's strengths
- Be patient with each other's struggles

[PILLAR INTEGRATION]
Strong partnerships require attention to ALL four pillars. Neglecting any one creates instability in the others."

### [6:00-8:30] Practical Co-Parenting Strategies
[VISUAL: Partners working together with baby]

"Creating effective co-parenting teamwork:

CO-PARENTING COMMUNICATION:

THE UNITED FRONT:
- Discuss parenting decisions privately first
- Present united decisions to family/friends
- Support each other's parenting in the moment
- Address disagreements away from baby

PARENTING PHILOSOPHY ALIGNMENT:
- Discuss core values about child-rearing
- Find common ground on major decisions
- Respect small differences in style
- Research parenting approaches together

CO-PARENTING LOGISTICS:

SCHEDULE COORDINATION:
- Share calendar access
- Weekly planning meetings
- Clear agreements about who handles what
- Backup plans for emergencies

RESPONSIBILITY ROTATION:
- Alternate night duties

CO-PARENTING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT:

VALIDATING EACH OTHER'S EXPERIENCE:

HANDLING PARENTING ANXIETY:
- Share worries without judgment
- Research concerns together
- Support each other's instincts

[CO-PARENTING CHALLENGES]

WHEN ONE PARENT IS MORE ANXIOUS:

- Seek help if anxiety is overwhelming

WHEN PARENTING STYLES DIFFER:
- Focus on shared values rather than identical methods
- Let each parent develop their own relationship with baby
- Support each other's strengths
- Compromise on issues that matter most

WHEN ONE PARENT FEELS LEFT OUT:
- Create opportunities for that parent to bond with baby
- Share baby care responsibilities equitably
- Acknowledge each parent's unique contributions
- Be patient with different bonding timelines

[CO-PARENTING SUCCESS PRINCIPLES]
- Both parents are learning and deserve patience
- There's no perfect way to do any of this
- Your baby benefits from having two parents who support each other
- Flexibility and communication solve most problems"

### [8:30-11:00] Intimacy and Connection During Transition
[VISUAL: Partners in gentle, non-sexual intimate connection]

INTIMACY DURING POSTPARTUM RECOVERY:

PHYSICAL INTIMACY:

- Prioritize connection over performance

EMOTIONAL INTIMACY:
- Share your real experiences, not just logistics

BARRIER: 'We feel like roommates'

[INTIMACY TIMELINE REALITY]
- Physical healing: 6+ weeks minimum

Everyone's timeline is different. Patience and communication are key."

Every day you choose to work on your partnership, you're:

[PARTNERSHIP VISION]
Imagine your partnership 5 years from now:
- How do you want to communicate with each other?

- How do you want to handle stress and challenges?
- What legacy do you want to create for your family?

This vision guides your daily choices and long-term commitment."
