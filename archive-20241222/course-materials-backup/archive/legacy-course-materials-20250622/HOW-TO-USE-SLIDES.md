# How to Use Your HTML Slides

## The Problem with the First File
The first HTML file tried to load images from your website folders, which doesn't work when opening the file locally. The new version fixes this!

## Using the Fixed Slides

### 1. Open the File
- Use `week1-slides-lesson1-fixed.html` (not the first one)
- Double-click to open in Chrome, Safari, or Edge
- You'll see beautiful, professional slides!

### 2. Navigate
- **→** or **Space** = Next slide
- **←** = Previous slide  
- **Home** = First slide
- **End** = Last slide

### 3. Fullscreen Mode
- **Windows**: Press F11
- **Mac**: Press Cmd + Ctrl + F
- This hides browser bars for clean recording

### 4. What You'll See
- Clean, professional design
- Your brand colors (sage green, pink, cream)
- Emojis instead of images (no loading issues)
- Smooth fade transitions
- Slide counter (1/13, etc.)
