## Key Messaging Shift

### FROM:
- Clinical, sanitized language
- "Grateful mother" expectations
- Quick recovery timeline
- Individual failure focus

### TO:
- Raw, honest validation
- "Survival is success"
- Long-haul recovery reality
- Systemic support focus

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 (Immediate):
- Add rage and PTSD modules
- Create survival toolkit
- Develop medication framework

### Phase 2 (Month 1):
- Design inclusive tracks
- Extend timeline content
- Train facilitators in lived experience

### Phase 3 (Months 2-3):

## Budget Estimate: $70,000

## The Bottom Line

Your course is already excellent. These enhancements will make it revolutionary. The focus on mental health over medical details is perfect. The additions address what mothers actually need at 3 AM on the bathroom floor, not what looks good in a clinical manual.

**Recommended new tagline**: "Real Support for the Raw Reality of New Motherhood"

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize the mom-voted top 5 enhancements
2. Recruit facilitators with lived experience
3. Pilot enhanced curriculum with focus group participants
