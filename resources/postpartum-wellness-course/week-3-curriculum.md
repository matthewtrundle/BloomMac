### The Depression-Inactivity Spiral
**How Depression Maintains Itself:**
- Low mood → Decreased activity → Less pleasure/accomplishment → Lower mood
- Physical depletion → Emotional exhaustion → Social withdrawal
- Breaking the cycle through strategic action

### Behavioral Activation Principles
1. **Action precedes motivation** (not vice versa)
2. **Small steps count** - Any movement forward matters
3. **Values-guided action** - Connect activities to what matters
4. **Outside-in approach** - Change behavior to shift mood
5. **Pleasure AND mastery** - Both types needed

### The Postpartum Activity Challenge
**Unique Barriers:**
- Physical recovery from birth
- Sleep deprivation
- Constant baby care demands
