# Week 2: Challenging Negative Thoughts & Building Emotional Awareness

## Learning Objectives
1. Identify common cognitive distortions in new motherhood
2. Learn thought-challenging techniques from CBT
3. Develop emotional awareness and regulation skills
4. Practice self-compassion exercises
5. Integrate partner/support person in recovery

## Psychoeducation Topics

### Common Postpartum Cognitive Distortions
1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**
   - "I'm a terrible mother" vs. "I'm learning and doing my best"
   - "My baby cries = I'm failing" vs. "Babies cry for many reasons"

2. **Mind Reading**
   - "Everyone thinks I'm incompetent"
   - "My partner is disappointed in me"

3. **Catastrophizing**
   - "My baby will be damaged forever if I make a mistake"
   - "I'll never feel like myself again"

4. **Should Statements**
   - "I should be happier"
   - "I should know what to do instinctively"
   - "I should be able to do this alone"

5. **Comparison Trap**
   - Social media comparisons
   - Idealized motherhood myths
   - Other mothers "doing it better"

### The Thought-Feeling-Behavior Connection
- **Situation** → **Thought** → **Feeling** → **Behavior**
- Example: Baby crying → "I'm failing" → Anxiety/Shame → Withdrawal
- Alternative: Baby crying → "Baby needs something" → Concern → Problem-solving

### Emotional Validation
- All feelings are valid information
- Difference between feelings and actions
- Hormonal influences on emotions
- Permission to feel the full spectrum

## Evidence-Based Coping Strategies

### 1. Thought Record Practice
**CBT Thought Record Format:**
1. **Situation**: What happened?
2. **Emotion**: What did you feel? (Rate 0-100%)
3. **Automatic Thought**: What went through your mind?
4. **Evidence For**: What supports this thought?
5. **Evidence Against**: What contradicts this thought?
6. **Balanced Thought**: More realistic perspective
7. **Re-rate Emotion**: How do you feel now? (0-100%)

### 2. Self-Compassion Break (Kristin Neff)
**Three Components:**
1. **Mindfulness**: "This is a moment of suffering"
2. **Common Humanity**: "Suffering is part of human experience"
3. **Self-Kindness**: "May I be kind to myself in this moment"

### 3. RAIN Technique for Difficult Emotions
- **R**ecognize: What am I experiencing?
- **A**llow: Can I let this be here?
- **I**nvestigate: What does this emotion need?
- **N**atural Awareness: Rest in compassionate awareness

## Therapeutic Homework

### Daily Assignments
1. **Thought Record Practice**
   - Complete one thought record daily
   - Focus on moments of distress or self-criticism
   - Practice generating balanced thoughts

2. **Self-Compassion Journal**
   - Write letter to self as you would to a good friend
   - List three things you did well today (no matter how small)
   - Practice self-compassion break during difficult moments

3. **Emotion Check-ins**
   - Name emotions 3x daily using emotion wheel
   - Rate intensity (1-10)
   - Note body sensations with emotions

### Partner Integration Exercise
**"Supporting Without Fixing" Conversation**
- Partner practices active listening for 10 minutes
- Mother shares feelings without partner offering solutions
- Partner reflects back what they heard
- Discuss what support looks like vs. "fixing"

### Weekly Behavioral Experiment
**Challenge One "Should" Statement**
- Identify one rigid rule (e.g., "I should never use formula")
- Test flexibility with small experiment
- Notice actual outcomes vs. feared outcomes
- Reflect on learning

## Assessment Questions

### Week 2 Progress Check
1. How many thought records did you complete?
2. What cognitive distortions do you notice most?
3. Rate your self-criticism (1-10) compared to last week
4. What self-compassion practice resonated most?
5. Any changes in mood or anxiety levels?

### Safety Screening
- PHQ-9 (depression screening)
