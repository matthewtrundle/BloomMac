## Script with Voice Engineering Markup

### **Celebration & Journey Recognition** (90 seconds)

[warm] If you're here, finishing this six-week journey with me, I want you to know something important. You're already doing something right. You've shown up, week after week, even when it was hard.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Hi, I'm Dr. Jana. Over these past six weeks, you've learned something profound: 95% of mothers recover fully with the right support. You've been getting that support. You've been doing the work. And it's working.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] This isn't a graduation—it's a milestone. The skills you've learned, the self-compassion you've cultivated, the connections you've deepened—these are resources you carry with you always.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] Find your comfortable position one more time with me. Maybe it's the same place you've been practicing, maybe somewhere new. Either way, you bring with you everything you've learned and integrated.

<break time="1.5s" />

[slowly] Take three breaths to arrive in this space of celebration. Each breath connects you to the strength you've discovered, the wisdom you've gained, the mother you've become.

<break time="2s" />

### **Progress Recognition Journey** (2.5 minutes)

[warm] Let's take a moment to make visible the invisible growth you've experienced. Sometimes we're so focused on what's next that we forget to acknowledge how far we've come.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Think back to Week 1, when you first heard about the fourth trimester, when you learned that your struggles were normal, adaptive, and temporary. How does that knowledge sit in your body now?

<break time="2s" />

[gently] Remember Week 2, when you first placed your hand on your heart and offered yourself compassion. How has that relationship with yourself shifted? How do you speak to yourself now when things are difficult?

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Week 3 opened your heart to support—recognizing that you weren't meant to do this alone. How has your relationship with asking for and receiving help evolved?

<break time="2s" />

[calmly] Week 4 taught you to work with anxiety rather than against it, to understand your nervous system as protective rather than broken. How has this changed your experience of worry and overwhelm?

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Week 5 honored your identity transformation—the sacred work of matrescence. How do you hold the complexity of being both mother and yourself now?

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Place your hand on your heart and feel how much has shifted. You are not the same mother who started this journey. You are stronger, wiser, more compassionate—both to yourself and to others.

<break time="2s" />

### **Strength Inventory & Embodiment** (2 minutes)

[compassionate] Now let's do something mothers rarely take time for—let's inventory your strengths. Not to boast, but to acknowledge the incredible capacities you've developed.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] You have learned to regulate your nervous system when anxiety arises. You have tools—the physiological sigh, body scans, self-compassion breaks. You know how to return to calm.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] You have expanded your capacity for self-compassion. You can catch the harsh inner critic and respond with kindness. You know that you deserve the same gentleness you give to others.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] You understand that motherhood is a learning process, not a performance. You know that "good enough" is actually excellent, that perfectionism is the enemy of connection.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Feel these strengths in your body. They're not abstract concepts—they're lived experiences, muscle memory, new neural pathways that will serve you for years to come.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] You are more resilient than you knew. You are wiser than you believed. You are stronger than you imagined. And you are exactly the mother your baby needs.

<break time="2s" />

### **Gratitude Practice** (2 minutes)

[peaceful] Gratitude is one of the most powerful practices for sustainable wellness. It trains your brain to notice what's going well, even in the midst of challenges.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Let's practice gratitude for your journey, starting with gratitude for yourself. Place both hands on your heart and feel appreciation for this woman who chose growth, who did the hard work, who showed up for herself and her family.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "I am grateful for my commitment to learning and growing."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "I am grateful for my capacity to love deeply and care fiercely."

<break time="2s" />

[gently] Now expand to gratitude for your support system—those who held you through difficult moments, who celebrated your successes, who reminded you that you're not alone.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Gratitude for your baby—the little teacher who called you into this profound transformation. Through loving them, you've learned to love yourself more fully.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] And gratitude for the struggles themselves—the sleepless nights that taught you resilience, the overwhelming moments that showed you your strength, the uncertainty that helped you trust yourself.

<break time="2s" />

### **Sustainable Wellness Vision** (2 minutes)

[calmly] As we complete this program, we plant seeds for your ongoing wellness. This isn't the end of your growth—it's the foundation for lifelong thriving.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Imagine yourself one year from now, continuing to use these tools. You still have challenging days, but you meet them with self-compassion and practical skills. You still feel overwhelmed sometimes, but you know how to regulate your nervous system.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] You model emotional intelligence for your child by taking care of your own emotional needs. You ask for help when you need it. You practice self-compassion openly, teaching your baby that humans deserve kindness.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] What one practice from these six weeks will you commit to maintaining? Maybe it's the daily self-compassion break. Maybe it's the grounding meditation. Maybe it's simply placing your hand on your heart when things get difficult.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Feel that commitment in your body. Not as pressure, but as a loving promise to yourself—to continue caring for the woman who cares for everyone else.

<break time="2s" />

### **Continued Journey Blessing** (90 seconds)

[compassionate] Beautiful mama, you now carry within you everything you need for the journey ahead. The tools, the wisdom, the self-compassion, the understanding that you are enough.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] There will still be difficult days. Progress isn't linear. You'll have days where you feel like yourself, followed by days where you might wonder if you'll ever feel normal again. Both of those experiences are part of the journey.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Remember what we've learned: Good enough mothering happens when you're attuned to your baby just 30% of the time. Not 100%. 30%. That's all it takes for healthy attachment. Take what serves you, leave what doesn't.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Take one final breath with me. As you exhale, send gratitude to yourself for this commitment to wellness. As you inhale, receive the love and appreciation you deserve.

<break time="2s" />

### **Completion & Blessing** (60 seconds)

[warm] When you're ready, gently open your eyes and return to your life with all the wisdom, strength, and compassion you've cultivated.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Remember: You are the expert on your baby. You know your baby better than anyone else in the world. Trust that expertise. You've brought life into this world. You've shown up for this course. You've taken steps to care for yourself. All of that is so extraordinary.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Research shows that 87% of mothers report feeling significantly better by six months. You're on that path. You're already stronger than you know. Women are superheroes—we're stronger than anyone gives us credit for.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] You have the right to rest. You have the right to feel all your emotions. You have the right to ask for help. You have the right to boundaries. You have the right to joy.

<break time="1.5s" />

[peaceful] 100% of mothers deserve support, including you. Thank you for being here with me. Until we meet again, remember—you're doing an incredible job.
