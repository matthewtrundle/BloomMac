## Script with Voice Engineering Markup

### **Introduction & Arrival** (90 seconds)

[warm] If you're listening to this at 3 a.m. while your baby finally sleeps, or you're hiding in your car for five minutes of peace... I've been there, and I see you.

<break time="1.5s" />

[compassionate] Hi, I'm Dr. Jana Rundle. And if you're here, listening to this, I want you to know something important. You're already doing something right. Seeking support takes courage, especially when you're exhausted and overwhelmed.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] Whether you have these full ten minutes, or whether you need to pause and come back—take what serves you, leave what doesn't. There's no right way to use this meditation. Your body is wise. What you're experiencing right now isn't random or broken.

<break time="1.5s" />

[peaceful] Find whatever position feels most supportive right now. Maybe you're sitting while your baby sleeps. Maybe you're holding your little one. Maybe you're lying down, finally horizontal after hours of walking and rocking.

<break time="2s" />

[whisper] Wherever you are, however you are—this is perfect. You are perfect for this moment.

<break time="2s" />

### **Biological Validation & Settling** (2 minutes)

[calmly] Let's begin by acknowledging something important: you are in your fourth trimester. The 12 week maternity leave is just something that someone made up. That is not based on any science. Research shows us this is a full twelve to eighteen month period of profound biological and psychological recovery.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Your body is wise. What you're experiencing right now—whether it's exhaustion, tenderness, emotional waves, or moments of overwhelming love—this isn't a personal failing. It's biology. This is your nervous system doing exactly what it evolved to do. It's evolution at its best.

<break time="1.5s" />

[soothing] Take three natural breaths with me. You don't need to change anything about how you're breathing—just notice.

<break time="1s" />

[slowly] Breathe in... recognizing that this breath is nourishing every cell in your recovering body.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] And breathe out... releasing any pressure to be anywhere other than exactly where you are.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] One more breath in... trusting in your body's ancient wisdom.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] And out... letting yourself arrive more fully in this moment of self-care.

<break time="2s" />

### **Body Wisdom Awareness** (3 minutes)

[peaceful] Now we're going to connect with your body—this incredible body that has done something extraordinary. Not to fix or change anything, but simply to honor what is.

<break time="1.5s" />

[gently] Starting with your feet, wherever they are. Maybe they're bare, maybe in socks, maybe in those slippers you've been living in. These feet that carry you through your days—step after step, sometimes when you can barely keep your eyes open.

<break time="1.5s" />

[warm] Send a silent "thank you" to your feet. They've walked hospital halls, paced nursery floors, stood swaying while you comfort your baby. They ground you to this earth even when everything else feels uncertain.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Move your attention to your legs. These legs that sometimes shake from exhaustion, that have learned to function on interrupted sleep. These legs that stand and rock and bounce when your baby needs soothing.

<break time="1.5s" />

[soothing] If there's tension here, that's information, not failure. Your legs are working hard. You can soften around them without needing to change them.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Bring awareness to your torso, your belly. This space that was home to your baby for nine months. Whether you birthed vaginally or by cesarean, whether your belly feels familiar or foreign—this space is sacred.

<break time="1.5s" />

[whisper] Place a hand here if you'd like. This isn't about appearance or timeline—this is about honoring the profound transformation your body has undergone.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Notice your arms and hands. These arms that have learned new choreography—the dance of diaper changes, the art of swaddling, the gentle sway that soothes both you and your baby.

<break time="1.5s" />

[compassionate] These hands that touch your baby with such gentleness, even when your own patience feels thin. Your hands know things now they never knew before.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Finally, your shoulders, neck, and head. These often carry so much—the weight of new responsibilities, the tension of hypervigilance, the physical demands of feeding and comforting.

<break time="1s" />

[gently] Let your shoulders drop away from your ears. There's no perfect position—just whatever feels like relief right now.

<break time="2s" />

### **Breath as Constant Companion** (2 minutes)

[peaceful] Your breath has been with you through every moment of this journey. Through contractions, through the first cry, through 3 AM feedings, through moments of pure joy and moments of uncertainty.

<break time="2s" />

[calmly] You don't need to control your breathing—just notice how your body breathes you. Notice the pause between inhaling and exhaling. Notice how effortless this is, even when everything else feels like effort.

<break time="2s" />

[whisper] If your mind wanders to feeding schedules, to sleep concerns, to whether your baby is okay in the other room—this is completely normal. The mind of a mother is always partly with her child.

<break time="1.5s" />

[warm] When you notice your mind has wandered, simply return to your breath like you're greeting an old friend. No judgment, no frustration—just a gentle return.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Your breath is always here for you. In the middle of difficult nights, during overwhelming days, in beautiful moments of connection with your baby—your breath is your most constant companion.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] With each breath, you can remember: beneath all the doing, all the caring, all the learning—you are still you. You haven't lost yourself; you're discovering parts of yourself you never knew existed.

<break time="2s" />

### **Self-Compassion & Permission** (2 minutes)

[compassionate] You have the right to rest. You have the right to feel all of your emotions without judgment. You have the right to ask for help. You have the right to make mistakes.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Place your hand on your heart, or wherever feels most comforting, and offer yourself these words—silently or whispered aloud:

<break time="1s" />

[slowly] "May I be gentle with myself as I learn."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May I remember that I am doing the best I can with what I have right now."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May I find moments of peace within this beautiful chaos."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May I trust that I am exactly the mother my baby needs."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May I know that seeking help and rest isn't weakness—it's wisdom."

<break time="2s" />

### **Integration & Gentle Return** (90 seconds)

[peaceful] Take a few more conscious breaths, feeling your body supported and your nervous system settling into this moment of calm.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Before you return to your day, set a gentle intention. Not a pressure or a promise, but a soft intention. Perhaps it's to remember this feeling of groundedness when things feel overwhelming. Perhaps it's to speak to yourself with this same kindness throughout your day.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Remember, this practice is always available to you. Even if you only have thirty seconds to take three conscious breaths—that's enough. Even one moment of returning to yourself matters.

<break time="1.5s" />

[soothing] This time you've taken for yourself? It's not selfish—it's essential. Your baby benefits when you care for yourself, because they feel your nervous system regulation. This is information, not failure.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Here's something I want you to know: 95% of mothers recover fully with the right support. 87% report feeling significantly better by six months. You're already stronger than you know. You've brought life into this world. You're showing up for this practice. All of that is so extraordinary.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] When you're ready, gently open your eyes if they were closed, or lift your gaze. You can be overwhelmed and capable at the same time. You can deeply love your baby while needing space for yourself. Both things are true.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Thank you for being here with me today. Remember—100% of mothers deserve support, including you.
