## Script with Voice Engineering Markup

### **Safety Assessment & Arrival** (90 seconds)

[calmly] If you're here because you can't stop checking if your baby is breathing, or because your mind races with worst-case scenarios at 3 a.m.—I've been there and I see you.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Hi, I'm Dr. Jana. Let me share what's actually happening to you right now. Your brain is literally reorganizing itself. The emotional centers of your brain are hyperactive, making you more alert to your baby's needs. This isn't a personal failing. It's biology. Your brain is protecting you.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Before we begin, let's create safety in this moment. Look around you. Notice that you are physically safe right now. Your baby is safe. You can pause this practice at any time if you need to.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] Find whatever position feels most secure. Maybe sitting with your back supported. Maybe lying down with a hand on your chest. Maybe even walking slowly as you listen. Your body knows what it needs.

<break time="1.5s" />

[calmly] Take three slow breaths with me. We're not trying to eliminate anxiety—we're learning to change your relationship with it.

<break time="2s" />

### **Understanding Your Anxious Body** (2 minutes)

[peaceful] Anxiety lives in your body before it becomes thoughts. Today we're going to scan through your body with curiosity rather than judgment, noticing where anxiety shows up and offering those places some relief.

<break time="2s" />

[calmly] First, let's acknowledge what anxiety is doing for you. It's your amygdala—your brain's smoke alarm—being extra sensitive to keep your baby safe. When you understand this, you can work with your nervous system instead of fighting against it.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Feel your breath moving your body. This is your built-in anxiety regulation system—always available, always working to bring you back to calm.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Take a breath that's just slightly longer on the exhale. In for four... out for six. This activates your vagus nerve—your body's natural calming pathway.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] You don't have to breathe perfectly. You don't have to eliminate all anxiety. You're simply giving your nervous system the message that you're safe in this moment.

<break time="2s" />

### **Body Scan for Anxiety Release** (4 minutes)

[calmly] Now we'll scan through your body, noticing where anxiety might be stored and offering those places some gentle relief. Remember, there's no wrong way to feel.

<break time="1.5s" />

[peaceful] Starting with your feet. Anxious mothers often feel ungrounded, like they're floating or disconnected. Wiggle your toes, press your feet into the ground. Feel how the earth supports you, even when your mind feels scattered.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Move to your legs. Sometimes anxiety makes our legs feel shaky or restless. You might notice tension from being "ready to run" even when there's no real danger. Breathe into your legs and let them know they can rest.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] Your belly and torso—often where anxiety lives most intensely. That familiar knot in your stomach, the flutter of worry, the tightness around your ribs. Place your hands here if it feels good.

<break time="1.5s" />

[slowly] Breathe into this space. You don't need to make the sensations go away—just breathe with them. Your body is working hard to protect you and your baby.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Your chest and heart area. Anxiety can make your heart race, make breathing feel shallow or difficult. This is your nervous system being vigilant, not your heart being weak.

<break time="1.5s" />

[soothing] Let your chest soften just slightly. If racing thoughts are coming up—about feeding schedules, sleep safety, your baby's development—simply notice them like clouds passing through the sky of your awareness.

<break time="2s" />

[calmly] Your shoulders, neck, and jaw. These often carry the tension of hypervigilance—constantly listening for your baby's cry, ready to respond to any need. This tension shows how deeply you care.

<break time="1.5s" />

[gently] Let your shoulders drop just a little. Soften your jaw. Release your tongue from the roof of your mouth. You can be alert and relaxed at the same time.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Finally, your head and mind. The anxious mother's mind is often spinning—running through scenarios, planning for problems, trying to control the uncontrollable. This mental activity is your brain trying to keep everyone safe.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] You don't have to stop your thoughts. Just notice them with the same gentle attention you'd give to your baby's babbling—interesting sounds that don't require immediate action.

<break time="2s" />

### **Nervous System Regulation** (2 minutes)

[calmly] Now let's give your nervous system some specific tools for regulation. These are techniques you can use anytime anxiety feels overwhelming.

<break time="1.5s" />

[peaceful] First, the physiological sigh—Dr. Andrew Huberman's research shows this is the fastest way to calm your nervous system. Take a normal breath in through your nose, then add a second, smaller breath on top. Then exhale slowly through your mouth.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Let's try it together. Breathe in... and in again... and out slowly through your mouth.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Feel how your nervous system responds to this signal of safety. You can do this anywhere—while feeding your baby, during the night, in the grocery store.

<break time="2s" />

[calmly] Next, bilateral stimulation—gently tap alternating sides of your body. This helps integrate the left and right brain, calming the anxious mind. You can tap your knees, cross your arms and tap your shoulders, or even just shift your weight from foot to foot.

<break time="1.5s" />

[peaceful] Try it now if you'd like. This rhythm soothes your nervous system the same way rocking soothes your baby.

<break time="2s" />

### **Anxiety Acceptance & Integration** (90 seconds)

[compassionate] Here's something radical: instead of fighting your anxiety, what if you thanked it? Your anxiety shows how much you love your baby, how seriously you take this role of mother.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Place your hand on your heart and silently say: "Thank you, anxiety, for trying to protect my baby. I can take it from here."

<break time="2s" />

[calmly] You can be anxious and still be a good mother. You can have racing thoughts and still be completely capable. You can feel overwhelmed and still be exactly what your baby needs. Both things are true.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Here's what research shows: 67% of new mothers experience significant anxiety. You're not broken. You're normal. And 95% of mothers recover fully with the right support. This is information, not failure.

<break time="2s" />

### **Closing & Daily Application** (60 seconds)

[peaceful] Before you return to your day, remember: you have tools now. The physiological sigh. Bilateral stimulation. The body scan. The understanding that anxiety is protection, not pathology.

<break time="2s" />

[calmly] When anxiety arises—and it will—you can respond with these tools instead of fighting against the feeling. You can work with your nervous system instead of against it.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Remember what I always say: You are the expert on your baby. You know your baby better than anyone else in the world. Trust that expertise, even when anxiety tries to tell you otherwise.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] When you're ready, gently open your eyes. You're already stronger than you know. You've brought life into this world. You're showing up for this practice. All of that is so extraordinary.

<break time="1.5s" />

[calmly] 100% of mothers deserve support, including you. Thank you for being here with me today.
