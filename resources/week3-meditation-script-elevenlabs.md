## Script with Voice Engineering Markup

### **Arrival & Heart-Opening Preparation** (90 seconds)

[warm] Maybe you're here because you're feeling isolated, or because asking for help feels impossible right now. I've been there and I see you.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Hi, I'm Dr. Jana. Let me share what's actually happening to you right now, because sometimes understanding the science helps reduce the blame. We are social primates. We're meant to live in communities. Many cultures have always known this—but we in the US have truly lost this wisdom in our modern rush to do everything alone.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Find your comfortable position. Maybe you're stealing these moments while your baby naps, or perhaps your little one is content nearby. Wherever you are, you belong in this circle of support we're creating together.

<break time="1.5s" />

[gently] Place one hand on your heart, feeling the rhythm that has been with you through every moment of this motherhood journey. This heart has expanded to love in ways you never knew possible.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Take three breaths to settle in. Each breath connects you not just to this moment, but to the web of love and support that holds you, even when you can't see it.

<break time="2s" />

### **Foundation: Self-Love** (2.5 minutes)

[peaceful] We begin where all healthy relationships begin—with a loving relationship with yourself. Building on the self-compassion you've been practicing, let's deepen into loving-kindness for the mother you are.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Feel your hand on your heart and imagine your heart space beginning to glow with warm, golden light. This light represents your inherent worthiness, your capacity for love, your strength as a mother.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Now offer yourself these words of loving-kindness, either silently or whispered:

<break time="1s" />

[slowly] "May I be happy."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May I be peaceful."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May I be free from unnecessary suffering."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May I have the support I need to thrive."

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] If resistance arises—if that inner voice says you don't deserve these wishes—that's normal. Perfectionism and overwhelm can make self-love feel foreign. Simply notice the resistance with kindness, and continue.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Imagine this golden light in your heart growing stronger with each loving wish. You are worthy of happiness, peace, freedom from suffering, and abundant support.

<break time="2s" />

### **Extending to Your Baby** (2 minutes)

[warm] Now we extend this loving-kindness to the one who made you a mother. Whether your baby is newborn or toddling, sleeping peacefully or going through a difficult phase—bring their sweet face to mind.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] See that golden light in your heart expanding, reaching toward your little one. This is the love that wakes you in the night, that celebrates their smallest milestones, that worries and rejoices in equal measure.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Offer your baby these wishes:

<break time="1s" />

[slowly] "May you be happy and healthy."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May you be peaceful and safe."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May you be free from unnecessary suffering."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May you grow up knowing how deeply you are loved."

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Notice how natural it feels to wish these things for your child. This loving-kindness is already alive in you—we're simply making it conscious, intentional.

<break time="2s" />

### **Including Your Partner/Co-Parent** (2 minutes)

[peaceful] Now we extend this love to your partner, co-parent, or the other important adult who shares this parenting journey with you. Relationships can become strained under the beautiful pressure of new parenthood.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Bring their face to mind—not in a moment of conflict or stress, but in a moment of tenderness. Maybe when they're sleeping, or when they first held your baby, or in a recent moment of connection.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] They too are learning, growing, adapting to this massive life change. They too have moments of doubt and overwhelm. Let your heart's golden light reach toward them.

<break time="1.5s" />

[slowly] "May you be happy and fulfilled."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May you be peaceful in this transition."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May you be free from unnecessary suffering."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May we support each other with patience and love."

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] If there's tension or hurt in your relationship, this practice isn't about pretending everything is perfect. It's about opening to the possibility of healing, of seeing each other through the lens of love rather than criticism.

<break time="2s" />

### **Embracing Your Support Network** (2.5 minutes)

[warm] Now we expand even further—to your support network. Your mother, your mother-in-law, your friends, your chosen family. The people who show up for you, even imperfectly.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Some may live far away. Some may not understand exactly what you're going through. Some may offer advice when you need listening, or listening when you need practical help. Bring them to mind with love and acceptance.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] See your heart's golden light expanding to encompass all these people who care about you and your baby. They form your village—the community that evolution designed to help you raise your child.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] For all your support network:

<break time="1s" />

[slowly] "May you be happy and well."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May you be peaceful."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May you be free from unnecessary suffering."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May we continue to support and love each other."

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] If you're feeling isolated, if your support network feels small or absent, include the support you're seeking. Open your heart to the connections that are coming, the help that is available, the community that wants to embrace you.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Remember: Asking for help is not a weakness. It is truly a strength. You have the right to ask for help. You have the right to boundaries. You have the right to say no to advice that doesn't serve you.

<break time="2s" />

### **Universal Mother Connection** (1.5 minutes)

[peaceful] Finally, we expand this loving-kindness to all mothers everywhere. The mother struggling with postpartum depression in another city. The mother celebrating her baby's first smile across the ocean. The mother who raised your partner, who raised your friends, who raised you.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] You're not the only one. I guarantee that you're not alone in feeling isolated. Every single mother throughout time has questioned whether she's doing enough, whether she's asking for too much help, whether she's a burden. Like, honestly, a remarkable thing—we all feel this way.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May all mothers be happy and supported."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May all mothers be peaceful."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May all mothers be free from unnecessary suffering."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "May all mothers know they are not alone."

<break time="2s" />

### **Integration & Closing** (90 seconds)

[compassionate] Take a moment to feel this expanded sense of connection. You are not an isolated mother struggling alone—you are part of a vast network of love and support, seen and unseen.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] This practice doesn't solve logistical challenges or fix difficult relationships, but it opens your heart to receive support and to offer it more freely. It reminds you that love is abundant, even when time and energy feel scarce.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Before you return to your day, set an intention to notice the support that is already around you. The friend who texts to check in. The stranger who smiles at you and your baby. The partner who holds your coffee while you change a diaper.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Support comes in many forms. Sometimes it's practical help. Sometimes it's simply being seen and understood. Sometimes it's the reminder that you're not alone in this beautiful, overwhelming journey.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] When you're ready, gently open your eyes. Remember: You can need help and still be a capable mother. You can feel lonely and still be deeply loved. Both things are true. You're already stronger than you know.

<break time="1.5s" />

[peaceful] 100% of mothers deserve support, including you. Thank you for being here with me today.
