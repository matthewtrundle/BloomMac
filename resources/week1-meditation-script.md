# Grounding Meditation for New Moms - Week 1
## 8-10 Minute Guided Practice

*This meditation is designed specifically for new mothers navigating the fourth trimester. Find a comfortable position, whether sitting or lying down. You can do this while your baby sleeps, or even while feeding or holding your little one.*

### Introduction (30 seconds)

Welcome, beautiful mama. Take a moment to arrive here, right now, in this space you've created for yourself. Whether you have 8 minutes or just 2, this time is yours. 

Notice that you've chosen to be here. That choice itself is an act of self-care, and that matters more than you might realize.

### Settling In (1 minute)

Begin by noticing your body exactly as it is right now. There's no need to change anything, just notice. 

If you're sitting, feel the support beneath you. If you're lying down, allow yourself to be held by whatever surface you're on. 

Let your eyes close if that feels comfortable, or soften your gaze toward the floor.

Take three natural breaths, and with each exhale, let yourself arrive a little more fully in this moment.

*Pause*

### Acknowledging Your Reality (1.5 minutes)

Right now, in this moment, you are enough. Your body, which may feel foreign or changed, has done something extraordinary. It has created life, sustained life, and continues to nurture life.

Whatever you're feeling right now - whether it's exhaustion, overwhelm, joy, confusion, or all of these at once - all of it is welcome here. There's no "right" way to feel as a new mother.

Take a breath in, and as you breathe out, release any pressure to feel different than you do right now.

*Pause*

If thoughts of your to-do list or your baby's needs arise, simply notice them like clouds passing through the sky of your awareness. They're there, and they're not going anywhere, but right now, you're here.

### Grounding in Your Body (2 minutes)

Now, we'll anchor ourselves in the present moment through your body. This body that has done so much, that continues to do so much.

Starting with your feet, whether they're bare or covered, notice them. Wiggle your toes if you can. These feet carry you through your days, step after step.

Move your attention to your legs. These legs that sometimes feel shaky from exhaustion, that stand and rock and pace when your baby needs soothing. Send them a silent "thank you."

Notice your belly and torso. This space that was home to your baby, that may still feel tender or unfamiliar. Place a hand there if you'd like. Breathe into this space with compassion.

Bring awareness to your arms and hands. These hands that learn new tasks every day - diaper changes, swaddling, gentle touches. These arms that hold and comfort. Notice the strength in them, even when they feel tired.

Finally, your shoulders, neck, and head. Often holding so much tension from worry and the physical demands of caring for a little one. Let your shoulders drop away from your ears. Soften your jaw.

### The Breath as Anchor (2 minutes)

Now, bring your attention to your breath - this automatic gift that sustains you moment by moment.

You don't need to change your breathing, just notice it. Notice the pause between your in-breath and out-breath. Notice how your body breathes you, without any effort from your mind.

If your mind wanders to feeding schedules, sleep concerns, or whether your baby is okay, that's completely normal. When you notice your mind has wandered, gently return to your breath like you're greeting an old friend.

Your breath is always here for you. In the middle of the night during feeds, during moments of overwhelm, during the beautiful chaos of this new life - your breath is your constant companion.

*Longer pause*

With each breath, you can return home to yourself. You can remember that beneath all the doing, the caring, the learning, you are still you.

### Loving-Kindness for Yourself (1.5 minutes)

Now, imagine speaking to yourself the way you would speak to your dearest friend who had just become a mother. What would you want her to know?

Silently or whisently, offer yourself these words:

"May I be gentle with myself as I learn."
*Pause*

"May I remember that I am doing the best I can with what I have."
*Pause*

"May I find moments of peace in the midst of change."
*Pause*

"May I trust that I am the right mother for my baby."
*Pause*

"May I know that seeking help and rest is not weakness, but wisdom."

### Integration and Closing (1.5 minutes)

Take a few more conscious breaths, feeling your body supported and your mind a little clearer.

Before you return to your day, set a gentle intention. Not a promise or pressure, but a soft intention. Perhaps it's to remember this feeling of groundedness when things feel chaotic. Perhaps it's to speak to yourself with the kindness you've practiced here.

Remember that this practice is always available to you. Even if you only have 30 seconds to take three conscious breaths, that's enough. Even one moment of returning to yourself matters.

When you're ready, gently open your eyes or lift your gaze. Take one more breath, and as you do, remember: you are not just surviving this phase - you are learning, growing, and becoming. And that is beautiful.

*Soft pause*

Thank you for taking this time for yourself. Your baby benefits when you care for yourself, and you deserve care simply because you are you.
