## Script with Voice Engineering Markup

### **Arrival & Self-Compassion Introduction** (90 seconds)

[warm] If you're squeezing this in between feedings, or listening while your baby contact naps on you—I see you. You're already practicing something profound by being here.

<break time="1.5s" />

[compassionate] Hi, I'm Dr. Jana. Today we're exploring something that research shows can literally change your nervous system—the practice of self-compassion. And here's what I want you to know: asking for help is not a weakness. It is truly a strength.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] Dr. Kristin Neff's groundbreaking research shows us that self-compassion is more effective than self-criticism. Let me say that again—being kind to yourself works better than being hard on yourself. This isn't soft science. This is hard data.

<break time="1.5s" />

[peaceful] Find your comfortable position. Maybe you're in a different place than last time—motherhood keeps us flexible, doesn't it? Whether you're sitting, lying down, or even walking with this as your companion—you belong here.

<break time="2s" />

[whisper] Let your eyes close if that feels safe, or soften your gaze. Take three breaths to arrive.

<break time="1.5s" />

[slowly] Breathing in, noticing that you've prioritized your well-being.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Breathing out, releasing any judgment about taking this time.

<break time="2s" />

### **Mindfulness: Acknowledging the Struggle** (2.5 minutes)

[calmly] The first step in self-compassion is mindfulness—simply noticing what's happening right now without trying to fix or change it. This is harder than it sounds, especially for mothers who are wired to solve and nurture.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Bring to mind a recent moment when you felt overwhelmed, stressed, or critical of yourself as a mother. Don't choose your worst moment—pick something moderately difficult. Maybe it was this morning, yesterday, or earlier this week.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Perhaps a moment when you lost patience with your baby's crying. Or when you compared yourself to other mothers online. Or when you felt like you weren't doing enough, despite doing everything.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] As you recall this situation, notice what happens in your body. Maybe your shoulders tense. Maybe your chest tightens. Maybe there's heaviness in your stomach. This is your nervous system remembering.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Now, place one or both hands on your heart, or wherever feels most comforting. This simple gesture signals safety to your nervous system.

<break time="1.5s" />

[slowly] And silently, or in a whisper, say to yourself: "This is a moment of suffering."

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] You're not being dramatic. You're not making it worse than it is. You're simply acknowledging what's true: this is hard. This hurts. This is difficult.

<break time="1.5s" />

[slowly] "This is a moment of suffering."

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Notice how different this feels from minimizing your pain or pushing it away. There's something powerful about naming our struggles with such clarity and kindness.

<break time="2s" />

### **Common Humanity: You Are Not Alone** (2.5 minutes)

[warm] The second step is remembering that you are not alone in your struggles. Your challenges don't isolate you—they connect you to the vast community of mothers throughout time.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Keep your hand on your heart and now say: "Suffering is part of motherhood."

<break time="2s" />

[gently] You're not the only one. Like, I've really heard it all in my therapy room. Right now, at this very moment, thousands of mothers are feeling exactly what you're feeling. And I guarantee that you're not alone in feeling them.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "I am not alone in feeling this way."

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Here's the truth: You can be a good mother and still lose your patience. You can deeply love your baby and still resent the demands of motherhood. You can feel capable and confident in one moment and then completely lost and overwhelmed in the next moment. Both things are true.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Think of a mother you love and respect. Maybe your own mother, a friend, or even a stranger you've witnessed loving their child beautifully. That mother has felt exactly what you're feeling.

<break time="1.5s" />

[slowly] "Other mothers have felt exactly what I'm feeling."

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Your imperfections, your struggles, your moments of losing it—these aren't signs of your failure. They're proof of your deep love and care. They're evidence of your humanity in a role that demands the impossible.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "This is part of the shared human experience of motherhood."

<break time="2s" />

### **Self-Kindness: Offering Yourself Love** (3 minutes)

[warm] The third step is offering yourself the same kindness you would naturally give to your dearest friend facing exactly what you're facing.

<break time="1.5s" />

[compassionate] Imagine your best friend called you right now with the exact struggle you've been thinking about. Picture her face, hear her voice telling you about her overwhelm, her self-doubt, her moment of losing patience.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] What would you say to her? What tone would you use? How would your heart open to her pain? You would probably speak to her with tenderness, with understanding, with love.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Now—and this is the radical part—speak to yourself in that same voice. Feel your hands on your heart and offer yourself these words:

<break time="1s" />

[slowly] "I have the right to rest."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "I have the right to feel all of my emotions without judgment."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "I have the right to ask for help."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "I have the right to make mistakes. I have the right to boundaries."

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Now speak to yourself as you would to that friend. What does your heart want you to know? Maybe it's: "You're doing the best you can with what you have right now."

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Or: "Your love for your baby is evident in your very concern about doing well."

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Or: "It's okay to be imperfect. Your baby doesn't need a perfect mother—they need their mother. You."

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Take a moment to offer yourself any words of kindness that feel authentic, that your heart truly wants to hear.

<break time="2s" />

### **Integration: The Three Steps Together** (90 seconds)

[calmly] Let's bring these three elements together: mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness. This is the self-compassion break—a practice you can use anytime, anywhere.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] When you notice yourself struggling, first: place your hand on your heart and acknowledge, "This is a moment of suffering."

<break time="1.5s" />

[slowly] Second: remind yourself, "Suffering is part of the human experience. I am not alone."

<break time="1.5s" />

[slowly] Third: offer yourself kindness, "May I be gentle with myself in this moment."

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] You can do this complete practice, or you can simply place your hand on your heart and speak one of these phrases. Even thirty seconds of self-compassion can shift your nervous system from stress to regulation.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Research shows that self-compassion activates the caregiving system in your brain—the same system that lights up when you comfort your baby. You're literally mothering yourself.

<break time="2s" />

### **Closing & Daily Integration** (60 seconds)

[compassionate] Before you return to your day, set an intention to catch yourself in moments of self-criticism. When you notice that harsh inner voice, try responding with your hand on your heart and one of these phrases.

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] Research shows that mothers who practice self-compassion have 60% less anxiety and 70% less depression. This isn't just feel-good stuff—this is changing your brain chemistry.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Remember: Good enough mothering happens when you're attuned to your baby just 30% of the time. Not 100%. 30%. That's all it takes for healthy attachment. This is information, not failure.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] When you're ready, gently open your eyes. You can be overwhelmed and still be a good mother. You can need help and still be strong. Both things are true.

<break time="1.5s" />

[warm] You're already stronger than you know. 100% of mothers deserve support, including you. Thank you for being here with me today.
