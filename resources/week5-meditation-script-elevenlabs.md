## Script with Voice Engineering Markup

### **Sacred Transformation Welcome** (90 seconds)

[warm] If you're here because you look in the mirror and don't recognize yourself, or because you're grieving the life you had before—I've been there and I see you.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Hi, I'm Dr. Jana. Today we're talking about something called matrescence—the psychological birth of a mother. It's an experience that was coined in the 1970s. When you think about adolescence being the shift from childhood to adulthood, you're shifting from not being a mother into motherhood.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] And when we think about adolescence happening over the course of several years, your shift is happening in the course of days. It's like, honestly, a remarkable thing. You haven't lost yourself; you're discovering parts of yourself you never knew existed.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] Find a position that honors both comfort and openness. This is sacred work—the integration of who you were, who you are now, and who you're becoming.

<break time="1.5s" />

[slowly] Take three breaths to arrive in this space of transformation. Each breath connects you to the ancient lineage of women who have navigated this passage before you.

<break time="2s" />

### **Honoring Who You Were** (2.5 minutes)

[warm] We begin by honoring the woman you were before motherhood. Not to return to her, but to acknowledge her gifts, her dreams, her contributions to who you are today.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Bring to mind the woman you were one year before your baby was born. See her face, remember her concerns, her passions, her daily life. She was whole and complete, just as you are now.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] What did she love? What brought her joy? What were her dreams, her goals, her ways of moving through the world? Take a moment to really see her with appreciation.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Place your hand on your heart and silently say to her: "Thank you for preparing me for this journey. Thank you for the strength, the love, the wisdom that now serves my family."

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] If there's grief here—for the simplicity of that life, for time that belonged only to you, for dreams that shifted or paused—that grief is holy. It honors what was precious.

<break time="1.5s" />

[peaceful] You don't have to let go of everything she loved. But you get to choose consciously what carries forward and what transforms into something new.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] Breathe in appreciation for who you were. She brought you to this moment of motherhood with everything you needed.

<break time="2s" />

### **Witnessing the Liminal Space** (2 minutes)

[gentle] Now we acknowledge where you are right now—in the liminal space. Liminal comes from the Latin word for threshold. You're between who you were and who you're becoming.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] This space can feel disorienting. One moment you feel like yourself, the next like a stranger. One day motherhood feels natural, the next completely foreign. This is normal in threshold times.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Dr. Jana teaches us about "both/and" thinking. You can be grateful for your baby AND miss your old life. You can love being a mother AND feel overwhelmed by the responsibility. You can appreciate your body's strength AND want it to heal faster.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Place both hands on your heart and breathe into this truth: "I can hold contradictory feelings. I am complex and human and whole."

<break time="2s" />

[soothing] The confusion you feel isn't a problem to solve—it's information about the magnitude of transformation happening within you. Your identity is reorganizing at the deepest level.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] You are in the sacred work of becoming. Trust the process, even when it feels chaotic.

<break time="2s" />

### **Embracing the Mother You Are** (2.5 minutes)

[warm] Now we turn toward the mother you are becoming—not the perfect mother from social media, but the real, complex, beautifully human mother that you are.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Think about a moment in the past week when you felt truly connected to your baby. Maybe during feeding, or watching them sleep, or when they smiled at you. Feel that love, that connection.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] This love—this fierce, overwhelming, sometimes frightening love—this is part of your expanded identity now. You are a woman who loves this deeply, this protectively.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] What kind of mother are you discovering yourself to be? Maybe you're more patient than you thought. Maybe you're stronger. Maybe you're more creative in your problem-solving. Maybe you're more vulnerable and more powerful at the same time.

<break time="2s" />

[compassionate] Place your hands wherever feels nurturing—your heart, your belly, your baby if they're with you—and offer yourself these words:

<break time="1s" />

[slowly] "I am exactly the mother my baby needs."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "I am growing into this role with love and wisdom."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] "I am allowed to be both mother and myself."

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] You can be overjoyed about your baby while simultaneously grieving your old life. You can deeply love your baby while resenting the demands of motherhood. You can want to be with your baby every moment while also desperately needing space. Both things are true.

<break time="2s" />

### **Values Integration** (2 minutes)

[calmly] Motherhood often clarifies what truly matters to you. Today we connect with your core values—the principles that guide you as both woman and mother.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] What values feel most important to you now? Maybe it's presence—being fully with your family. Maybe it's authenticity—showing up as yourself. Maybe it's balance—honoring both your needs and your family's needs.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] Your values might have shifted since becoming a mother. What felt urgent before might feel less important now. What you took for granted might feel precious. This is wisdom, not loss.

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Choose one value that feels most central to who you are as a mother. Feel it in your body. Imagine this value as a golden thread running through all your choices, all your relationships, all your moments with your baby.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] This value connects the woman you were to the mother you are to the person you're becoming. It's a bridge across the transformation.

<break time="2s" />

### **Future Self Visioning** (90 seconds)

[peaceful] Finally, we connect with the integrated woman you're becoming—five years from now, when this transformation has fully unfolded.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] See her: confident in her motherhood, clear about her values, comfortable with the beautiful complexity of being both woman and mother. She remembers this time of becoming with tenderness.

<break time="2s" />

[gently] What would she want you to know right now? Maybe: "Trust the process. You don't have to have it all figured out. You are becoming exactly who you need to be."

<break time="2s" />

[slowly] Feel her love and pride for you, right now, in the middle of the messy, beautiful work of becoming.

<break time="2s" />

### **Integration & Closing** (60 seconds)

[compassionate] You are not the same woman who became pregnant. You are not meant to be. This isn't a personal failing. It's biology. It's psychology. It's evolution at its best.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] Think about the grace we offer teenagers when they're moody, when they're impulsive, when they crave sleep all the time. Let's try to offer ourselves the same kind of grace while we go through this extreme transition into motherhood.

<break time="2s" />

[warm] When you're ready, open your eyes. Remember: You can miss your old life and love your new one. You can be grateful and overwhelmed. You can feel lost and found at the same time. Both things are true.

<break time="2s" />

[peaceful] You're already stronger than you know. Women are superheroes—we're stronger than anyone gives us credit for.

<break time="1.5s" />

[warm] 100% of mothers deserve support, including you. Thank you for being here with me today.
