## Project Status: Week 1 Course Restructure

### What We've Accomplished

#### Week 1 Lessons Restructured:
1. **Lesson 1: Welcome to Your Postpartum Journey (12 min)** âœ…
   - Shifted from philosophical to welcoming/orienting tone
   - Simplified neuroscience content
   - Added clear course roadmap
   - Files: `lesson1/index-v2.html`, `week1-lesson1-script-v2.md`

2. **Lesson 2: What's Normal vs. What's Not (14 min)** âœ…
   - Expanded to cover physical AND emotional normalcy
   - Added comprehensive warning signs
   - Included help-seeking scripts
   - Files: `lesson2/index-v2.html`, `week1-lesson2-script-v2.md`

3. **Lesson 3: The Science of Postpartum Changes (11 min)** âœ…
   - Pure science focus (hormones, brain, sleep)
   - Removed emotional processing techniques
   - Simplified complex concepts
   - Files: `lesson3/index-v2.html`, script pending

4. **Lesson 4: Honoring Your Experience (13 min)** ðŸ”„
   - Needs both presentation and script
   - Should validate feelings, add maternal intuition
   - Strengthen self-trust message

### Key Decisions Made
- Allow flexibility on 12-minute target (13-14 min OK)
- Keep existing slides where possible (70% reuse)
- Expert guidance: prioritize normalization, education, assessment, hope
- Archive all old files with dates to prevent confusion

### Current File Locations
**New v2 Files:**
- Presentations: `/public/presentations/week1/lesson[1-3]/index-v2.html`
- Scripts: `/course-materials/week1-lesson[1-3]-script-v2.md`

**Archived Files:**
- `/archive/week1-legacy-20241222/` - Old Week 1 content
- `/course-materials/archive/legacy-course-materials-20241222/` - Old guides

**Reference Materials:**
- `/course-materials/COMPLETE-COURSE-WEEK[1-6].md` - Original content
- `/course-materials/week1-detailed-content-outline-v2.md` - New structure

### Next Steps When Resuming
1. Complete Lesson 3 script
2. Create Lesson 4 presentation and script
3. Implement new folder structure
4. Move all files to consolidated location
5. Update course management system
6. Continue with Week 2

### Course Structure Overview
**6 Weeks Total:**
