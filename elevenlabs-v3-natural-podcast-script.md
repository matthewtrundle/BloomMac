## NATURAL CONVERSATION SCRIPT:

**Emma:** [sighs] You know what? I couldn't sleep last night. Just... kept thinking about those families at Camp Mystic. [pause] My daughter asked me about it yesterday and I just—[voice breaks slightly]—I froze.

**Madison:** [softly] Oh Emma... [overlapping] I know, I know exactly—

**Emma:** [interrupting] —and the worst part? She already knew! Her friends were talking about it at school and I'm there trying to pretend everything's fine when—[laughs nervously]—when I can barely process it myself.

**Madison:** [exhales] Mine heard about it at summer camp. [pause] God, summer camp. The irony, right? [bitter laugh]

**Emma:** [overlapping] Right? It's just—

**Madison:** [continuing] —and suddenly I'm trying to explain something that I... [trails off] [quietly] that I don't even understand.

[pause - 2 seconds]

**Emma:** [taking a breath] Okay. Welcome to... [laughs softly] well, this isn't our usual episode of the Bloom Psychology Podcast. I'm Emma Thompson—

**Madison:** [gently] And I'm Madison Roberts. And today we're just... we're talking parent to parent about something that's been weighing on all our hearts.

**Emma:** We've brought in Dr. Rachel Williams. She's a child psychologist who—[voice brightens slightly]—thank God—actually knows how to navigate these conversations.

**Dr. Williams:** [warm, grounding voice] Thank you both. And can I just say? [pause] What you're feeling right now? That frozen feeling? [gentle] That's completely normal.

**Madison:** [relieved exhale] Really?

**Dr. Williams:** Absolutely. You know, children are incredibly perceptive. They pick up on our anxiety even when we think we're hiding it. [thoughtful] Sometimes... sometimes our silence speaks louder than our words.

**Emma:** [rueful laugh] Well that's terrifying.

**Dr. Williams:** [laughs softly] I know. But here's the thing—

**Madison:** [interrupting anxiously] But how do we even start? Like, what do you say to a six-year-old about—[voice catches]—about something like this?

**Dr. Williams:** [reassuring] Okay, let's break this down. For younger kids—we're talking 4 to 7—you keep it incredibly simple. [speaking slowly, demonstrating] "There was a big storm that made the water rise very fast. Some people got hurt, but lots of helpers came to take care of them."

**Emma:** [processing] That's... that's it?

**Dr. Williams:** That's it. [firm but kind] They don't need more.

**Madison:** [overlapping] But what about—

**Dr. Williams:** [gently interrupting] Older kids? 8 to 12? They can handle a bit more. "Heavy rains caused flooding at a summer camp. Emergency teams saved many people, but some were hurt or died." [pause] Notice I still mention the helpers?

**Emma:** [recognition dawning] Oh! Like Mr. Rogers said—

**Madison and Dr. Williams:** [in unison] "Look for the helpers."

[All three laugh softly]

**Madison:** [sighs] My son asked me why God let this happen.

[uncomfortable pause]

**Emma:** [quietly] Oh Madison...

**Dr. Williams:** [thoughtful] You know what? It's okay to say "I don't know." [pause] Really. "I don't know why bad things happen, but I know we can help each other get through them."

**Madison:** [skeptical] But won't that make them more scared? Not having answers?

**Dr. Williams:** Actually? [surprising them] Kids find honesty reassuring. It's the pretending that scares them.

[pause]

**Emma:** [vulnerable] Can I... can I share something? [nervous laugh] I've been doom-scrolling at 2 AM. Just... refreshing news sites over and over and—

**Madison:** [relieved, interrupting] —oh thank God it's not just me! I thought I was losing it—

**Emma:** [overlapping] —and each update just makes it worse—

**Madison:** [continuing] —but I can't stop—

**Dr. Williams:** [cutting in gently but firmly] Okay. Both of you. [pause] Listen to me. [softer] We can't pour from an empty cup.

[silence]

**Dr. Williams:** [continuing] Your kids? They're watching you for cues on how to feel. If you're anxious and overwhelmed—[lets that hang]

**Emma:** [defensive] But we can't just ignore what happened!

**Dr. Williams:** No. [pause] But we can set boundaries. Check news twice a day. Morning and evening. That's it.

**Madison:** [skeptical] Easier said than—

**Dr. Williams:** [interrupting] Replace the urge. When you want to grab your phone? Make tea. Take three deep breaths. Do the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise—

**Emma:** [curious] The what?

**Dr. Williams:** Five things you can see. [counting on fingers] Four you can touch. Three you can hear. Two you can smell. One you can taste. [pause] Brings you right back to the present.

**Madison:** [trying it] Okay, so... I see the microphone, the soundboard—[trails off] Huh. That actually... [surprised] that works.

**Emma:** [confession] I had a full breakdown in the shower yesterday. [embarrassed laugh] Just... sobbing.

**Dr. Williams:** Good.

**Emma and Madison:** [surprised, overlapping] Good?!

**Dr. Williams:** [affirming] Emotions need to move through us. Better in the shower than in front of your kids if they're not ready for that.

[thoughtful pause]

**Madison:** [shifting topics] So what about... like, practical things? What can we actually DO with our kids?

**Dr. Williams:** [energized] Oh, this is where it gets good. Creative expression is incredibly powerful. Drawing, writing, even playing with toys—

**Emma:** [interrupting excitedly] My daughter wrote cards! She just... decided to write cards for the families and—[voice softens with pride]—it was completely her idea.

**Dr. Williams:** [delighted] That's perfect! See, action is the antidote to anxiety. Even small gestures—

**Madison:** [worried, cutting in] But when should we worry? Like, when is it more than just... processing?

**Dr. Williams:** [serious but calm] Watch for persistent changes. Nightmares lasting more than two weeks. Refusing normal activities. Regression—like bedwetting. [pause] Those are signs to reach out for help.

**Emma:** [quickly] And there's no shame in that, right?

**Dr. Williams:** [firmly] Absolutely no shame. We take our kids to the doctor for strep throat. [pointed pause] Their emotional health deserves the same care.

[moment of quiet understanding]

**Madison:** [reflective] You know what gets me? How do we help them find meaning in something so... senseless?

**Dr. Williams:** [thoughtful] We focus on what we can control. How we respond. How we help. How we show up for each other. [pause] Kids are remarkably resilient when they feel supported.

**Emma:** [wonderstruck] My daughter... she asked if we could donate her camp supplies to kids who might need them. [voice catches] She's seven.

**Madison:** [touched] Oh, Emma...

**Dr. Williams:** [moved] See? Children often show us the way forward. They have this incredible capacity for hope when we give them the right support.

[pause]

**Emma:** [sighs deeply] This is... this is hard.

**Madison:** [agreeing] So hard.

**Dr. Williams:** [gently] It is. [pause] But you're doing it. You're showing up. You're asking the questions. [warmly] That's what matters.

**Emma:** [emotional] Dr. Williams, thank you. Just... thank you for helping us through this.

**Dr. Williams:** Thank you for having the courage to have this conversation. [to listeners] These talks matter.

**Madison:** [to audience] If you're listening and navigating these waters... [pause] you're not alone. You don't have to be perfect. Just... be present.

**Emma:** [wrapping up] We'll have resources in our show notes. Ways to connect with child therapists in your area. And remember—[voice strengthens]—at Bloom Psychology, we're here for your family's journey. Especially through the tough moments.

**Madison:** [softly] Take care of yourselves...

**Emma:** [joining] So you can take care of them.

[pause]

**Both:** [gently, together] From all of us at Bloom Psychology.

[soft exhale from both]
