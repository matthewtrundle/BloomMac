### Security Improvements Deployed

1. **No more service role keys in client code** ✅
2. **Contact form using secure RPC function** ✅
3. **All API routes using proper authentication** ✅
4. **Middleware enhanced with better auth handling** ✅

### Monitoring Checklist (Next 2 Hours)

- [ ] Check Vercel logs every 30 minutes
- [ ] Monitor Supabase dashboard for errors
- [ ] Watch for any authentication failures
- [ ] Track contact form submission success rate
- [ ] Monitor API response times

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Contact Form Success Rate**
   - Target: >95%
   - Current: 100% (1/1 test)

2. **API Error Rate**
   - Target: <1%
