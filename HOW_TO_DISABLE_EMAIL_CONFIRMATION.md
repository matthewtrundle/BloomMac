# How to Disable Email Confirmation (If Needed)

## Option 1: Keep It Enabled (Recommended) ✅

I've fixed the issue by:
1. Creating a proper `/auth/confirm` route that handles `token_hash`
2. Updated email template to use `/auth/confirm` instead of `/auth/callback`

**Just update your email template with FINAL_WORKING_EMAIL_TEMPLATE.html**

## Option 2: Disable Email Confirmation ⚠️

If you still have issues and want to disable it temporarily:

### In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Authentication → Settings**
2. Find **Email Auth** section
3. Toggle OFF **"Confirm email"**
4. Click **Save**

### What happens when disabled:
- Users can login immediately after signup
- No email verification required
- Less secure but works immediately

### To re-enable later:
- Same steps, toggle ON "Confirm email"
- Update email template with proper URLs

## Testing Without Disabling

Use the test user I created:
- Email: `test@bloom.com`
- Password: `TestBloom123!`

This user has pre-confirmed email and bypasses the confirmation flow.
