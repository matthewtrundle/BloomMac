- [ ] Voice selection finalized based on expert recommendations
- [ ] Production settings optimized for therapeutic content

**2. Technical Configuration**
```
Recommended Voice: Rachel (warmth + authority) or Sarah (credibility + calm)
Model: Eleven Multilingual v2 or Eleven v3 (for audio tags)
Speed: 0.8-0.85 (slower for meditative pacing)
Stability: 65-75 (stable but emotionally responsive)
Similarity: 75 (maintains consistency across series)
```

**3. Quality Assurance Protocols**
- [ ] 30-second test samples generated for each script
- [ ] Emotional tone validation completed
- [ ] Pacing and pause timing verified
- [ ] Series consistency confirmed

### **Phase 2: Production Execution**

**1. Individual Meditation Generation**
```
Production Order (recommended):
1. Week 1 (foundational - establish voice/tone)
2. Week 2 (builds complexity)
3. Week 6 (completion - test emotional range)
4. Week 3, 4, 5 (middle content with established parameters)
```

**2. ElevenLabs Studio Workflow**
```
For Each Meditation:
1. Input script with emotional tags
2. Generate initial voiceover
3. Review for quality and emotional accuracy
4. Regenerate problematic segments if needed
5. Export high-quality WAV file
6. Document production notes and settings
```

**3. Quality Control Checkpoints**

3. Light compression for consistency (-3:1 ratio, slow attack/release)
4. Subtle reverb for spatial depth (0.8-1.2 second decay)
5. Master to -16 LUFS for streaming platforms
```

**2. Background Elements (Optional)**
```
Ambient Sound Options:
- Gentle nature sounds (ocean waves, rainfall)
- Soft instrumental music (avoid melodies that compete)
